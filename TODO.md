# To Do list

List of requirements and ideas not yet implemented

HPS - software defined infrastructure based on von Neumann with controller 

Write quickstart

Hardware prep
Very minimal for test / dev:
Laptop / test computer
- docker and KVM on 1 PC
Minimal useful operation
Desktop PC's, Raspberry Pi's
- Storage host - 50GB disk
- Compute host - 16GB RAM, 4 cores
Network
- MTU Jubo frames?
- Multicast?

For each step - action - things to do
Output - what to expect

HPS

- identify IPS host
- requirements:
  - sysadmin caps
  - idelly dedicated network / vlan
  - docker-compose
  - git
  - space 5GB per O/S
  - logging space
- install docker & git
- clone / copy hps-container
- start: docker-compose up -d
- when ready (cloned hps-system):
  - run cluster-configure
  - set basics
- plug in net


UI
- report statuses of boot, systems etc
- self-check results, lest performed
- O/S age, if updates available locally or remotely
- load, health status
- performance
- availablilty

Security
- add authenticate() to each call, and verify authorty before doing anything

IPS replication
- clone IPS to diffent physical hosts, swithc between which is live
- take care to manage config file writes, for example, lock whilst migrating, and somehow rediretc nay writes to new live, or reject and expect far end to retry

Folder structure

Node/host scripts and profiles
reconstruct folders to be 
- /arch-os_tag/
  - packages.list
  - <profiles>/
    - packages.list
  - install-scripts/
  - tests

Repo
- separate repo clone function
- use either live repos or take repo c;lone of full O/S
- locally the installer will introsepct all packages for any configured profile/os, and copy to local cache
- so IPS only has required packages, and has all required packages 
  - auto parse packages for deps and pull down
- augmented with local packages
- public repo -> local clone ->
              -> IPS packages -> installer
- this minimises IPS size, dosent replicate 90% of unused packages from the repo, and integrity checks all required packages are available, for each o/s version
- full clone option for each O/S means that the repo clone can download full versions for full off-line development
  - yet IPS has subset
  - o/s has data on local repos

O/S support
- Add Debian
- Raspberry Pi arch support


management interface
- creeate boot progile for management display
  - boots up with graphichal touch interfaces
  - allows view of network in real time
  - shows build of netwokr plus hosts configured but not running
  
iPXE / boot improvements
- reduce boot manager usage, by sending sub-opts to ipxe, which cn then configure directly, when host is configured already - see https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/kea/-/issues/2366#note_284084
- iPXE Audit
  - Compile full iPXE version to include pciscan and other functions
Make host_hardware_hash
if hash changed since last boot, warn, show side by side diffences, log what changed


syslog
- log to one file
- logging both from internal looging per host and syslogging
- remote host can ask if syslog working by sending ley and asking if the key was logged, and if so, swithc to justs syslof, as it is much more efficient than bot manager for logging
- catch trigger commands, calling notifications
- library of triggers, and what to do - alert or other action, such as email
- create boot sessions, log messages with the boot session ID for each running system, so messages can be grouped - based on hostname and boot time hash - keep short
  - boot_time=$(date +%s); session_hash=$(echo "${hostname}:${boot_time}" | sha256sum | cut -c1-6); echo $session_hash
   - With 50 active sessions: 0.007% chance of collision

supervisor imprvements
- break out service configs, to their own functions, better create a supervisor-fragment creation function, send it the args, to make it easier to add new services

logrotate service
- install to supervisord

self-tests
- IPS once started runs test suite to ensure all systems and functions working, reports back when done, logs results
- Hosts have tests so when booted, verify that they are fit for purpose
- retests can be carried out periodically, to make sure that integrity remains
- integrity tests can also check for what is not expected, like hashes of file system etc, to make sure nothing added or modified

- Make-docs 
  - skip functions that no longer exist
  - create section docs as compiled sections, sp only merge existing in to sectiondoc, plus header
- Replace nginx with sozu
- create hps_config get/set/unset function
  - replace all HPS_variables with this
- Set resources with hps_config vars
- Tag host config with o/s and version variables
- Update ipxe menu to choose software for host
- Add host-conf UI
  - list uncnfigured hosts, configure them from cli
- create cluster config for configure_at - terminal, cli
  - if not terminal, dont presnt menu, just search for active config, update status to searching
  - if status is reboot, then reboot

## Provision iSCSI on SCH for thin servers


Thin Node - boot disk deploy: order of events

At SCH creation time:

- ‚úÖ HPS Node functions loaded
- HPS Node function wrapper created
- ‚úÖ zpool created automatically and name stored in SCH host config
- üîÑ SCH runs functions to create these scripts so om can run them later:
  - node_create_zvol taking in the zpool name and 
  - node_create_lio_script to create local lio script, and puts in /srv/scripts
- Hand to om

om apps / local scripts to create:

- update_scripts
- node_storage_manager



At diskless server creation time

- ‚ùå If no disks defined in host config ISCSI_ROOT_0 or ISCSI_ROOT_1, HPS sends message via om to all of class storage node requesting disk provision offers.
  - SCH will respond if it can service the request 
    - script required
    - If no responses, config aborts with warning
  - IQN is then built based on SCH response iscsi target address/port, zpool (IQN_HOST), plus client name and volume name (IQN_VOL).
  - request sent to SCH with IQN_HOST IQN_VOL to do the provision and make ready (via lio script)
    - either create a new empty volume
    - or this may be a clone of an existing volume
  - when confirmed, IQN_HOST:IQN_VOL written to the host config ISCSI_ROOT_0 or ISCSI_ROOT_1 on the client
  - Then volumes mounted to md raid for booting / instralling, or possibly to send a pre-built image
- At install time
  - HPS Node functions loaded
  - Configure as TCN, CCN, DR node etc
  - configure additional disks with md if required, then add LVM, provision by sending request to HPS, getting back commands to configure storage
  
At diskless runtime

- Expanding storage - automated
  - HPS Node functions loaded
  - From Diskless, Send om message to expand the zvol for each disk in a mirror
  - get commands to rescan the md PV with pvresize, then lvextend --resizefs for the volume


## Boot audit

For any host withut full audit, boot to temp image, get full hardware audit, and reboot
- periodically re-audit

## Boot simplification
- use DNSMasq to detect current state, send client stright to the command, skipping ipxe logic




### OpenSVC / om

- Requires manual install on IPS: root@docker-01:/# dpkg -i /srv/hps-resources/packages/downloads/opensvc-server_3.0.0~alpha96.0.g36e4abf6+deb13_amd64.deb 


#### instead of scripts, call functions:

oot@dev2n1:~/dev/om3# om restarts config show --section task#envfunc
[task#envfunc]
command = . /tmp/functions.sh && envfunc

root@dev2n1:~/dev/om3# cat /tmp/functions.sh
envfunc() {
    /usr/bin/env
}
root@dev2n1:~/dev/om3# om restarts run --rid task#envfunc

#### Create a task with om to report on free disk i stead of app

Call with:  om restarts run --rid task#env --node=\*
will respond with:
OBJECT    NODE    SID                                   
restarts  dev2n1  847b0b13-0e1b-4237-bc0b-90330ccf0dd5  
restarts  dev2n3  a878ea67-3636-488e-aec6-15177fd9fbc0  
restarts  dev2n2  8eb2f65b-752b-4e61-a1e2-a7f31c7f9879  

and also can catch stdout etc matching on the SID

root@dev2n1:~/dev/om3# om restarts config show --section task#env
[task#env]
command = /usr/bin/env

Create function to make the opensvc app that runs lio:

om svc create -s iscsi-manager --wait
om svc set -s iscsi-manager \
  --kw app#iscsi_manager.type=forking \
  --kw app#iscsi_manager.start="/srv/scripts/lio start" \
  --kw app#iscsi_manager.stop="/srv/scripts/lio stop" \
  --kw app#iscsi_manager.check="/srv/scripts/lio check"


om svc provision -s iscsi-manager --wait


Implementation of IQN is not fully compliant with the RFC 3720/3721 IQN naming standard (iqn.yyyy-mm.naming-authority:unique-nameiqn.yyyy-mm.naming-authority:unique-name) as a reverse domain name is not used (unless the cluster happens to be a reverse domain name).

The main compliance issue is that the naming authority part must be a reversed DNS name, not just a cluster or arbitrary name. The unique name section after the colon can contain host and volume names as in the example.

This is because it is unlikely that the cluster relates to any particular domain name.

The chosen structure will be unique within the HPS and these exports are not intended to be used on the public network.

The format chosen is:
iqn.<yyyy-mm>.<cluster-name>:<host-name>.<volume-name>

For example: iqn.2025-09.test-1:sch-001.vda



## Refactoring of scripts and libraries

## Registering new host

If current MAC exists, reuse the hostname instead of issuing a new one at 'install new TCH'


### Function naming

- HPS functions: available to the HPS operations
- Node functions: available on the nodes prefixed by n_

Node functions can use the http api to access the HPS, and call HPS functions. 
HPS functions have full access to all parts of HPS

### Script renaming: boot_manager

boot manager should be renamed to hps-api as it now provides a wide range of functions available via ipxe and Node functions.

### hps-api

- output formatted as json, text, html, pxe etc depending on how it is called
- Add json api in addition to query string for better structure

### Function: cgi_auto_fail

- if browser, send html (currently text)
- if cli, send json (currently text)
- if ipxe, send pxe (done)
- if unknown, send text (done)

## Feature development


### Cluster policy

- Set policy for cliuster, so monitoring knows what to expect
- multi-disk?
- multi node?
- etc

### Generic file reader / writer

- use lock files
- check r/w capability
- standardise warnings through hps_log
- check file for integrity before and after
  - this verifies the structure and variables
- ensure all values are clean ie no quotes etc
- All names uppercase

### host config

add host_config unset

### clustter  config

add cluster_config unset

### hps_config

create

### Storage nodes - O/S Installation (A/B method)

- Create built image, then deploy to host, ready for A/B updates
- Deployed via PXE

Outline:

- Base partitioning scheme (one-time)
  - PXE-boot the new node into a minimal installer (initrd or rescue).
  - Partition the system disk(s) with:
      - EFI/boot partition.
      - Two root partitions (e.g. /dev/sda2 and /dev/sda3) sized to hold the OS image (A/B scheme).
      - Any additional data/storage partitions/ZFS pools.
  - Install GRUB/EFI loader once.
- Seed initial OS image
  - Mount root partition ‚ÄúA‚Äù at /mnt/newroot.
  - Deploy base OS image from provisioning node (tarball, rsync, zfs recv, or raw dd).
  - Install bootloader into /mnt/newroot.
  - Configure /etc/fstab for A/B root partitions.
  - Set boot entry ‚Üí root ‚ÄúA‚Äù.
- Reboot into node
  - Node boots cleanly into base image.
  - At first boot, inject hostname, cluster membership, IP config (via cloud-init NoCloud, systemd-firstboot, or HPS CGI).
  - Register with HPS provisioning node.
- Subsequent updates
  - Use same process as for existing nodes:
      - Deploy image into the inactive root partition.
      - Update bootloader.
      - Reboot with rollback safety.

### Storage nodes - O/S updates (A/B method)

- Instead of kickstart, create images and deploy to new hardware
- manage incremental updates through package manager
- deploy new O/S every 2 months (or on demand)

Outline:

- Prepare new system image
  - Build root filesystem (Kickstart/Autoinstall, debootstrap, or chroot build).
  - Export as tar.gz, raw image, or ZFS snapshot.
- Provision target host
  - Ensure host has two root partitions/datasets (A/B scheme).
  - Identify which one is active (currently mounted as /).
  - Select the inactive partition/dataset for new deployment.
- Deploy image
  - Mount the inactive partition at /mnt/newroot.
  - Extract/sync image into /mnt/newroot (tar, rsync, or zfs recv).
  - Bind-mount /dev, /proc, /sys into /mnt/newroot and chroot to install bootloader (grub2).
- Update bootloader config
  - Add new boot entry pointing to /mnt/newroot.
  - Optionally make it default once (so rollback is automatic if it fails).
  - Preserve old entry as rollback target.
- Switch active root
  - Mark new partition as default boot target (grub-set-default, zpool set bootfs=, etc.).
- Reboot into new system
  - Downtime = reboot only.
  - Host comes up on fresh image.
- Verify and cleanup
  - Health check storage services.
  - If OK ‚Üí mark new root permanent.
  - If not ‚Üí reboot back into old partition (rollback).


### ZFS

- add the multi disk 

## New functions

- Verify storage can host more than one cluster
  - will it need separate networks?

### IPS Replicate

- Replicate to each storage node
- Replicate to DRH
- Must exist 2 times plus DRH
- Auto sync data (resoirces, config)
- Config relayed to replicants?
- OpenSVC to stop/start container when required with IPS address

### Cluster network config

- Set the following - default to IPS:
  - DNS_LOCAL_SERVER
  - SMTP_LOCAL_SERVER
  - NTP_LOCAL_SERVER
  - SYSLOG_LOCAL_SERVER
- And set options for upstreams
  - DNS_UPSTREAM_SERVER
  - SMTP_UPSTREAM_SERVER
  - NTP_UPSTREAM_SERVER
  - SYSLOG_UPSTREAM_SERVER

- DEFAULT_ROUTE

### Cluster isolation

Enable ability to write to external location, yet limit what comes in

Firewall - part of the cluster? Containerised? On IPS?

- ALLOW_CLUSTER_EXTERNAL_DNS
- ALLOW_CLUSTER_EXTERNAL_SMTP
- ALLOW_CLUSTER_EXTERNAL_ROUTING


### Network visualisation

- Visualise the network config via web page and pdf print
- include current state of each node in visualisation

### Monitoring

- Implement platform monitoring at IPS
- Availability, performance

### syslog

- Add syslog daemon to hps, send all messages to syslog
- add buffering on sending hosts
- Create standardised syslog tag structure, so messages can be managed accordingly
  - manage messages that are not tagged
- don't store local logs on machines
- add dhcp option to set syslog server

### time

- add time service to IPS

### SMTP relay

- exim on IPS

### create node by duplication/clone

- zvol image duplication
- duplicate config file
- set key variables
- Create new host by duplicating zvol
- for thin compute nodes
- Implement function, available in ipxe and cli

## Security

- only send my config to my MAC address, decline to anyone else - Done
- only send my cluster ifo to members of my cluster
- reject all queries from unknown MAC, with one exception
  - only allow initial config options to systems that we have dhcp booted
- Don't allow sensitive config elements to be provided via the api
