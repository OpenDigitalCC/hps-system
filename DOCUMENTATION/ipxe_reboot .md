### Function overview

The `ipxe_reboot` is a Bash function that initiates a reboot procedure and logs this activity. The function accepts a custom message as a parameter, which influences the activities during the reboot process. The function first logs the call to reboot, provides an iPXE header, then depending on presence or absence of the custom message, it echoes that message or merely proceeds to announce a reboot initiation. Then, the system suspends the operation for 5 seconds, and finally reboots.

### Technical description

```definition-block
name: ipxe_reboot
description: A bash function used to initiate and log a reboot activity on a system.
globals: [ MSG: the custom message that is echoed during the reboot process ] 
arguments: [ $1 (MSG): Custom message to be logged and echoed during the reboot sequence ]
outputs: 
   - Log messages about the reboot.
   - Echoed messages either custom MSG or standard "Rebooting..." message.
returns: The function itself does not have any return command, hence nothing gets returned.
example usage: 
- ipxe_reboot "System update performed, rebooting now."
- ipxe_reboot "Unexpected error occurred, rebooting."
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Always ensure to sanitize and validate the custom message (MSG) input to prevent command injection attacks.
2. Add an optional timeout parameter to give users control over sleep duration instead of hardcoding sleep as 5 seconds. This might be useful in different operational conditions.
3. The logging functionality (`hps_log`) should have proper permission checks to avoid unauthorized access and potential data tampering. Additionally, it should handle log management aspects such as log rotation, size limitations and sensitive data exclusion.
4. If possible, avoid using direct console output (via `echo`) for important messages. Consider using a logging mechanism instead.
5. The function does not check whether the reboot command succeeds or not. It could be improved by adding error handling to catch any failure during the reboot process and respond accordingly.
