## `configure_dnsmasq `

Contained in `lib/functions.d/configure_dnsmasq.sh`

### Function overview

The `configure_dnsmasq` function is responsible for setting up and configuring dnsmasq on a DHCP IP. This function first checks if the DHCP IP exists in the active cluster, then generates a configuration file for dnsmasq and copies certain necessary files to the TFTP directory. If the DHCP IP does not exist, the function exits and outputs an error message.

### Technical description

- **Name**: `configure_dnsmasq`
- **Description**: This function sets up dnsmasq configuration on a DHCP IP. It checks if the IP exists, generates a dnsmasq configuration file, and copies necessary iPXE files to the TFTP directory.
- **Globals**: 
   - `DHCP_IP`: The IP address used for DHCP.
   - `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR`: Directory for service configuration files.
   - `HPS_TFTP_DIR`: Directory for TFTP.
- **Arguments**:
   - None
- **Outputs**: Messages indicating the progress and result of the configuration. 
- **Returns**: No return value, but it does exit the script if the DHCP IP is not present.
- **Example usage**: `configure_dnsmasq`

### Quality and security recommendations

- It is recommended to include more error handling for cases where required files are not successfully copied to the TFTP directory. 
- Consider sanitizing or validating the `DHCP_IP` and the `NETWORK_CIDR` to prevent potential security issues.
- The references to the external file paths should be validated that they exist and are readable before attempting to use them.
- Some global variables' values are directly inserted into configuration files, it's recommended to verify and sanitize these values to make sure they do not contain any malicious or unexpected inputs.
- It would be ideal to implement good practices for creating secure temporary files. Examples are: using `mktemp` for creating temporary files and explicitly setting proper file permissions.
