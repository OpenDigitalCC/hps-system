## `generate_ks`

Contained in `lib/functions.d/kickstart-functions.sh`

### Function overview

The `generate_ks` function is primarily used for generating kickstart configurations for a given host type and macid. It logs information about the function calls as well as requests for kickstart while setting up plain CGI headers. Configurable host variables are made available for the installer script including important network settings such as IP, netmask, hostname etc. It sets the state of the host configuration to "INSTALLING" and offers the script for the host installation.

### Technical description

- **Name:** `generate_ks`
- **Description:** Generates a kickstart configuration for a given host type and macid (MAC ID), sets up required host variables, sets the state of the host configuration to "INSTALLING" and logs information.
- **Globals:** 
  - `macid`: Contains macid (MAC ID) passed as argument.
  - `HOST_TYPE`: Contains host type passed as argument.
- **Arguments:** 
  - `$1`: macid (MAC ID)
  - `$2`: Host type
- **Outputs:** Logs information about function calls and kickstart requests. Prints the contents of the installation script after rendering the template.
- **Returns:** Does not return a value
- **Example usage:** 
```bash
generate_ks "macid123" "host_type123"
```

### Quality and security recommendations

- It might be worth considering the return of values or exit statuses after critical steps, e.g., after retrieving the host configuration.
- An explicit error handling should be added, so that steps with potential failure (such as loading the host configuration) return an error message and an appropriate status code.
- Logging should be improved. All the activities within the function should be logged, not just when the function has been called.
- Some variables are set but never used (commented out). These variables should be removed if not required.
- Sensitive data such as IP and MAC IDs should be handled securely and stored encrypted if needed.
- The function could benefit from a more defensive programming style (for instance, validating arguments before use).
- The use of globals is not recommended because it allows for variables that can be modified by any part of the program. It's better to replace globals with function arguments or return values if possible.
- The function should be refactored to make it less complex and easier to maintain.
