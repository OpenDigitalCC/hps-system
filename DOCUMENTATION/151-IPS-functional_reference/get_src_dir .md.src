### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Given the static nature of this function, if multiple scripts or processes are using it, consider setting the value of source directory as an environment variable. 
   
2. If the source path may change in future, consider passing the path as an argument to the function to enhance flexibility. 

3. Avoid hardcoding paths when possible as they are prone to typos and make relocation of files difficult. Use variables or configuration files instead.

4. Always check the existence of the directory before attempting to use it in your scripts. This can prevent errors during execution, such as a `No such file or directory` error.

5. Ensure that the necessary read or write permissions are set for any directories that your scripts will access. This way, you protect sensitive data and prevent potential errors during the execution.

6. Regularly update and maintain your scripts to ensure they are safe, efficient, and reliable. This includes regular code reviews, testing, and keeping up-to-date with best practices.
