### Function Overview

The `package` function is a simple custom bash function that is used to create a package directory structure and copy contents from a source directory to the newly created package directory.

### Technical Description

- **Name**: package
- **Description**: This function will create a package directory and copy contents of a given path 'startdir' to the package subdirectory 'usr.'
- **Globals**: 
    - `pkgdir`: This refers to the name or path of the package directory to be created.
    - `startdir`: This indicates the source directory whose contents are to be copied to the newly created package directory.
- **Arguments**: None
- **Outputs**: The function will output any error or success messages from the `mkdir` and `cp` commands.
- **Returns**: The function does not return any value.
- **Example usage**: `package` 

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. **Input Validation**: Ensure there is validation for the global variables `pkgdir` and `startdir`, as these are user provided paths and can be subject to path traversal and other form of input related attacks.
2. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to catch any issues when creating directories or copying files around. This is necessary to prevent any issues such as cyclic file copying or references to non-existent directories.
3. **Permissions**: Be vigilant about the permissions of the directories and files being created. This could allow for potential unauthorized access if not properly managed.
4. **Dependencies**: Check the dependencies for `mkdir` and `cp` on the system where this function will run. For portability, these commands are not always available or behave differently on alternative Unix-like systems.
5. **Documentation**: Comment and document the script properly so that it becomes easy to understand and modify in the future.
