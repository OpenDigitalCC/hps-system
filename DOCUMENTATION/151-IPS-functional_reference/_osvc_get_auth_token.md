1. Input validation: Even though this function doesn't currently take any arguments, checks should be built into the function in case arguments are added in the future.
2. Error handling: Better error handling could be implemented. For example, if the `om` command cannot execute, the function might fail with a non-descriptive error.
3. Logging: Consider adding logs in order to make debugging easier in case of problems.
4. Security: Consider restricting the permissions of the script containing this function to prevent unintended access. Also, careful handling of the authentication token is essential to prevent any security vulnerabilities.
