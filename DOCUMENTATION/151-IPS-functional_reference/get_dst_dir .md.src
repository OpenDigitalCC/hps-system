Function signature: a90d8dd365ef92d8a352f764798d19209b4fc64ef2e59c431bd6f7a5870c005f

### Function Overview

The `get_dst_dir` function is a utility function used within bash scripts. Its purpose is to return a string representing a specific directory path ("/srv/build/opensvc-om3").

### Technical Description

```markdown
- Name: `get_dst_dir`
- Description: This function does not take any arguments, nor does it rely on global variables. It is hardcoded to return the string "/srv/build/opensvc-om3" which is expected to denote a directory path.
- Globals: None.
- Arguments: None.
- Outputs: A string output "/srv/build/opensvc-om3".
- Returns: Nothing out of the ordinary. It always echoes "/srv/build/opensvc-om3" to STDOUT.
- Example usage:

```bash
$ DIRECTORY_PATH=$(get_dst_dir)
$ echo $DIRECTORY_PATH
/srv/build/opensvc-om3
```
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Instead of hardcoding the directory path, provide it as an argument or use a configuration file. Hardcoding paths can lead to security vulnerabilities and make maintenance harder.
2. Validate directory paths before usage to ensure that they exist and have the appropriate permission levels before being accessed, to avoid unauthorized access and usage.
3. Handle errors gracefully - In case the directory doesn't exist or isn't accessible, the function should return an error code and ideally an informative error message.
4. Use more descriptive function and variable names to improve code readability and maintainability.
5. Consider proper segmentation of concerns. If the directory path should change for different environments or scenarios, the function may become problematic.
