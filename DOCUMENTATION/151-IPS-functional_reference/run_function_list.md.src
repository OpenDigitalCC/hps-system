Function signature: 9332f51df9c8b0d77c5f2b16e6f5e98293a660ace81153ea206e9ab1b86c0e9c

### Function Overview

The `run_function_list` function in Bash is designed to sequentially run a list of functions passed as arguments. If a function fails to run successfully, the function displays a log message indicating the failed function and its exit code before returning said exit code. If all functions run successfully, a log message indicating successful execution is displayed.

### Technical Description

- __Name__: `run_function_list`
- __Description__: This function is intended to take a list of functions as arguments, run them sequentially. It also does error handling by checking the exit code of each function run, logging errors and exiting if a function fails.
- __Globals__: None
- __Arguments__: 
  - `$@`- This is an array-like construct of all arguments passed to the script.
- __Outputs__: Log messages about the running status of each function, indicating if whether it's currently running, have failed or have been completed successfully.
- __Returns__: Exit code of the failed function if any fails, or 0 if all functions complete successfully.
- __Example usage__: 

```
function1() {
  echo "Running Function 1"
}

function2() {
  echo "Running Function 2"
}

run_function_list function1 function2
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Ensure necessary error handlers are in place to deal with any failure that may occur within any of the functions being run.
2. Avoid including functions that modify global state or perform operations with side effects as these could be ordering dependent and cause unexpected behaviors.
3. Be cautious with the number and complexity of the functions passed. A large number of complex functions could result in long execution time or memory exhaustion.
4. Regularly review the logging information to catch any failures at their early stage. Adding more detailed logging could provide more insights into what is happening within each function.
5. Validate the input to ensure that the correct number and types of arguments have been passed to the `run_function_list` function to ensure its correct execution.
