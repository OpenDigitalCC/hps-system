### Function overview

The function `prepare_custom_repo_for_distro` is designed to prepare a custom repository for a specified Linux distribution. The function takes in a distribution string and any number of package sources or names. It identifies file sources and package names, creates a repository directory, and then either downloads or copies packages as necessary to the created directory. Finally, it builds the repository and verifies the necessary packages are included. 

### Technical description

- **Name**: `prepare_custom_repo_for_distro`
- **Description**: This Bash function prepares a custom repository for a specific Linux distribution. It identifies package sources and names, creates the repository directory, downloads or copies package files to the directory, builds the repository, and verifies the required packages.
- **Globals**: There’s one global variable used, namely `HPS_PACKAGES_DIR`. This is the base directory where the custom distribution-specific repository directory will be created.
- **Arguments**: 
	- `$1`: The distribution string that will be used to create a distribution-specific directory within the base repository directory.
	- `$@`: An array of package sources and/or names.
- **Outputs**: Text information about the ongoing process is logged using `hps_log` function and error messages are logged if something goes wrong creating the directory, downloading or copying packages, building the repository, or verifying the required packages. 
- **Returns**: The function has different return codes based on the kind of error it encounters. They are as follows:
    - 1 if there is a failure in creating the repository directory.
    - 2 if there's a failure in downloading a package.
    - 3 if there's a failure in copying a local file.
    - 4 if there's an invalid package source.
    - 5 if the building of yum repo metadata fails.
    - 6 if there is a missing required package in the repository. If the function executes successfully, it returns 0.

- **Example usage**: `prepare_custom_repo_for_distro ubuntu16 hhtps://package1.com package2`

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Input Validation: You should validate the inputs to the function to ensure they are not null, and that they meet any other necessary criteria (e.g., distribution string is from a known set).
2. Error Handling: Add error handling for more return conditions to ensure the function doesn’t execute unnecessary steps or gives a clear and exact error message when it fails.
3. System Commands: Carefully review your use of system commands such as `mkdir` and `cp`. Consider adding checks to confirm whether files and directories exist before you try to create or copy them. Also, consider the possible security implications of using these commands, as injecting malicious input could lead to unintended behavior.
4. Logging: Add more logging at each critical points of the function execution to better understand the behaviour. This can be especially useful in understanding unexpected failures in the future.
5. Global Variables: The usage of global variables could lead to unexpected behavior if they are modified elsewhere in the script. Consider passing `HPS_PACKAGES_DIR` as an argument to the function if possible.
