## `fetch_source_file`

Contained in `lib/functions.d/prepare-external-deps.sh`

### Function overview

The `fetch_source_file` function is built to download a file from a provided URL and store it in a destination directory. If no filename is given, it deduces the filename from the URL. It first checks if the file already exists in the destination directory, if so it skips the download process. If the file does not exist, it attempts to download it, and provides relevant feedback on the process.

### Technical description

`fetch_source_file` is defined as follows:
- **name**: `fetch_source_file`
- **description**: Downloads a file from the input URL and stores it into a defined directory. If the file is already present, downloading is skipped.
- **globals**: [ `HPS_PACKAGES_DIR`: Directory where the files are downloaded. Default is `/srv/hps-resources/packages/src`] 
- **arguments**: [ `$1`: URL to download the file from, `$2`: Name of the file to download. This value is optional, and if not provided, the name is inferred from the URL ]
- **outputs**: Status of the download operation (successful, already exists, or failed)
- **returns**: Download status represented by Boolean values (0: Success or file already exists, 1: Fail)
- **example usage**:
    ```
    fetch_source_file "http://example.com/file.tar.gz" "testfile.tar.gz"
    ```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Use different variables or add validation checks to avoid the possibility of variable overlap, ensuring that the `url` and `filename` variables are valid.

2. Verify the successful creation of the directory prior to attempting the download operation. 

3. Add timeout to the CURL request to prevent the script hanging indefinitely if the URL is inaccessible.

4. Make use of secured protocols (HTTPS) to download files, this ensures the integrity and confidentiality of the downloaded files.

5. Ensure that the file successfully downloaded is as expected, via checksumming or other verification process.

6. Handle errors appropriately, not just echoing to stderr. This can be done with a custom error function or dedicated error handling segments.
