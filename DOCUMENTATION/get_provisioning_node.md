## `get_provisioning_node`

Contained in `lib/functions.d/configure-distro.sh`

### Function Overview
The `get_provisioning_node` function provides an effortless way to retrieve the default gateway IP address in a Linux environment, also referred to as the provisioning node. This function utilizes the `ip route` and `awk` command-line utilities to extract and display the IP address of the default gateway.

### Technical Description
##### `get_provisioning_node`
This Bash function retrieves the default gateway IP address.

**Globals**: None

**Arguments**: None

**Outputs**: The default gateway IP address (provisioning node)

**Returns**: None

**Example Usage**:
```bash
get_provisioning_node
# Output: 192.168.1.1 (actual output differs based on network configuration)
```
This function doesn't take any input parameters and doesn't use global variables. When called, it displays the IP address of the default gateway.

### Quality and Security Recommendations
- The function should handle the error case where "ip route" command is not available or the user does not have required permissions.
- Consider sanitizing the output of the `ip route` command to ensure it only returns valid IP addresses.
- It would be beneficial to provide a fallback option in case the IP command fails to return the expected result.
- The function does not currently return an exit code which can be a potential limitation if used within another script that depends on the success/failure of the function. To enhance usability, consider having the function return an exit code based on the success of the IP address retrieval operation.
- Use this function with caution as revealing the IP address of your default gateway could potentially expose your network to security risks. Therefore, it is recommended to use it within a secure and trusted environment.
- Lastly, always follow the principle of least privilege. Only grant permissions required for executing the function. This helps minimize any potential damage if the function is misused or mishandled.
