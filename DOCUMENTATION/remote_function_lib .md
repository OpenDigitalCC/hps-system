## `remote_function_lib `

Contained in `lib/functions.d/kickstart-functions.sh`

### Function Overview
The `remote_function_lib` function is used as a container for other functions that are to be injected in pre and post sections of a script. It outputs the functions as Here Documents (EOF) which is a technique used to output a multiline string, thereby avoiding any lexical scoping issues that may arise during execution. These functions could be used across scripts, hence, the advantage of centralizing them with this function.

### Technical Description
**Name:** `remote_function_lib` 

**Description:** This function acts as a library for other functions which are to be used in scripts' pre and post sections. It injects these functions by using the "cat" command along with EOF to hold these functions as heredoc strings. Currently, the function does not have any additional custom functions inside but could be populated accordingly.

**Globals:** None

**Arguments:** The function does not take any arguments

**Outputs:** Prints the functions that are to be injected in pre and post sections via STDOUT.

**Returns:** None

**Example Usage:**
Depending on the functions needed in the pre and post sections of the script, they could be added into the `remote_function_lib` function. Below is a hypothetical usage:
```bash
remote_function_lib () {
cat <<EOF
sample_function () {
  echo "This is a sample function"
}
EOF
}
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

- To improve reusability and maintainability, consider moving this function into separate standalone file, especially if the function lists are growing larger.
- Add a parameter to the function that specifies which functions to include. This way, you can have one large library of functions, and only include the ones you need.
- Ensure that the inserted code is free of malicious content or bugs. This requires validation, either manually or through automated tests.
- Consider making this function read-only to prevent any unauthorized changes. In bash, you can do this using the `readonly` keyword.
- Always check and handle errors. Since you're using `cat` to insert functions, you should check its return value to make sure it succeeded. If not, stop execution and print an error message.
