## `__ui_log`

Contained in `lib/functions.d/cli-ui.sh`

### 1. Function overview
The function `__ui_log` is a simple bash function whose primary purpose is to log messages to the standard error output stream (stderr). The messages are prefixed with `[UI]` to indicate the context/source of the log, which in this case is the user interface (UI).

### 2. Technical description
**Function Name:** `__ui_log`

**Description:** A bash function used for logging messages to the stderr with a UI prefix. 

**Globals:**
* None

**Arguments:**
* `$*` - Represents all arguments passed to the function. Each argument is treated as a separate word or string. 

**Outputs:** 
* Outputs the string `[UI]` followed by the string arguments passed to the function to stderr.

**Returns:**
* Does not return any values.

**Example Usage:**
```bash
__ui_log "This is a log message"
# Output: [UI] This is a log message
```

### 3. Quality and security recommendations
* Use a more descriptive name for the function. The current name `__ui_log` does not clearly describe the purpose of the function.
* Include error handling in the function. Check whether the correct number and type of arguments are passed to the function before proceeding with the logging.
* Since the function writes to stderr, consider if all situations where the function will be used are truly error conditions. If not, consider writing non-error output to stdout instead.
* Use consistent formatting and indenting throughout your code to aid readability.
* Be cautious about the information you choose to log. If this function is used to log sensitive information, it could pose a security risk.
* Validate and sanitize input arguments to prevent command injection attacks.
