## `fetch_and_register_source_file`

Contained in `lib/functions.d/prepare-external-deps.sh`

### Function overview

This function, `fetch_and_register_source_file`, is primarily used for fetching a source file from an input URL and registering it with a specific handler. It takes in three parameters: a URL, a handler, and an optional filename, which is obtained by extracting the base name from the URL if it's not supplied. The function fetches the source file by calling the `fetch_source_file` function with the URL and filename as arguments. If that's successful, it then proceeds to register this source file by calling `register_source_file` with the filename and handler as arguments.

### Technical description

- **Name:** fetch_and_register_source_file

- **Description:** This function fetches a source file from a given URL and registers it with a specified handler. If the download is successful, it proceeds to registration.

- **Globals:** None

- **Arguments:** 
  - `$1 (url)`: The URL from where the source file is fetched.
  - `$2 (handler)`: The handler with which the source file is registered.
  - `$3 (filename)`: An optional argument. When not provided, the base name from the URL is used as the filename.

- **Outputs:** The function doesn't directly produce any output. However, the `fetch_source_file` and `register_source_file` functions called by it may produce output.

- **Returns:** If the fetch operation fails, the function returns false. If the fetch operation succeeds, the function calls `register_source_file` and returns its return value.

- **Example usage:** 

```
fetch_and_register_source_file "http://example.com/file.txt" "handler_name"
```

### Quality and security recommendations

- **Error Handling and Reporting:** There should be handling for cases when the provided URL is not a valid URL or when the URL, handler or filename does not exist or are not accessible. Also, it would be beneficial to add informative messages for the user in case something goes wrong. 
- **Input Validation:** Consider validating the URL before using it, checking for potential security issues like some form of injection or files that are too large.
- **Output validation:** The outputs of the `fetch_source_file` and `register_source_file` functions should be validated.
- **Encryption:** If the function is used for transferring sensitive data, encryption should be enforced during the fetch operation. It should also confirm the integrity of the downloaded files, possibly through checksums or digital signatures.
- **Data privacy:** If user data is processed, the function should respect the privacy of users and follow the data protection laws. Besides, personal identifiers should be sufficiently anonymized during the processing.
- **Documentation:** It would be helpful to have more detailed comments in the function to help other developers easily understand its purpose and functionality.
