## `ipxe_cgi_fail `

Contained in `lib/functions.d/ipxe-menu-functions.sh`

### 1. Function Overview

The function `ipxe_cgi_fail` is used in error handling within the iPXE boot firmware configuration. This function is typically called when there is a failure or an error occurred during the network booting process. When called, it displays an error message, after which it awaits for 10 seconds before initiating a system reboot. 

### 2. Technical Description

The below description in detail explains each component of the `ipxe_cgi_fail` function.

- **Name:** `ipxe_cgi_fail`

- **Description:** This function is invoked when an error occurs during the iPXE boot process. It generates an iPXE header using the `ipxe_header` function, logs the error message using the `hps_log` function, and then prints the error message on the screen. Finally, it puts the system into sleep for 10 seconds and performs a reboot.

- **Globals:** None.

- **Arguments:** 
    - `$1: cfmsg` - This represents the custom fail message, which is passed as an argument to the function.

- **Outputs:** This function logs the error message format to the console: "== ERROR ==". Also, it sets the iPXE to sleep for 10 seconds and then reboot.

- **Returns:** This function does not return any value because once it is invoked, it exits the current execution and initiates a reboot after a sleep duration of 10 seconds.

- **Example Usage:**
  ```
  ipxe_cgi_fail "Network boot failed"
  ```

### 3. Quality and Security Recommendations

Here are some quality and security improvements recommended for the `ipxe_cgi_fail` function:

- Logging: Improve logging to include information about the specific error and the environment that caused the error.
- Validation: Validate the input parameter to prevent potential code injections or crashes due to undefined variables.
- Error Handling: A defined strategy for error handling to guarantee the system stability and high-availability performance after the execution of this function.
- Communication of Errors: It might make sense to communicate major errors to a central error log or even an alerting system, so they do not go unnoticed.
- Sleep & Reboot strategy: Depending on your specific situation, you might need to review your system's sleep and reboot strategy for better performance or for minimizing downtime.
