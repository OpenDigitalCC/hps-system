## `print_cluster_variables`

Contained in `lib/functions.d/cluster-functions.sh`

### Function overview

The Bash function `print_cluster_variables()` is primarily used to read, interpret and display cluster configuration data. The configuration file is obtained from an active cluster by means of another function call. The function reads through the configuration file line by line, where each line is expected to have its keys and values separated by an '='. In the process of reading, it ignores blank lines and comments, while also stripping out the surrounding quotes of the values before displaying them. If the configuration file does not exist, it informs the user and terminates the operation.

### Technical description

- **Name**: `print_cluster_variables`
- **Description**: This function reads a configuration file of an active cluster, processes its content to extract the key-value pairs, and prints them. Blank lines and comments are ignored during the process. If the configuration file does not exist, an error message is printed.
- **Globals**: None
- **Arguments**: None
- **Outputs**: Prints the key-value pairs found in the configuration file of the active cluster, or a configuration file not found error message.
- **Returns**: 1 if the configuration file does not exist, otherwise no explicit return value.
- **Example usage**
    ```
    print_cluster_variables
    ```

### Quality and security recommendations

- It's recommended to add error handling for when the `get_active_cluster_filename` function call fails or returns an invalid filename.
- Incorporate permissions validations to ensure only authorized and authenticated users can access this function.
- A key-value pair validation can help mitigate risks of processing malformed data from the configuration file.
- Implementing a secure method of password or sensitive information evasion when printing the variables is recommended to ensure that no sensitive data is exposed in logs or console outputs.
- Additionally, sanitize outputs to avoid any potential command injections or related security threats.
