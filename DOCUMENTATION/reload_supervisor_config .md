## `reload_supervisor_config `

Contained in `lib/functions.d/configure-supervisor.sh`

### Function Overview
The `reload_supervisor_config` function is specifically designed for managing changes made to the multiple processes or programs run by the supervisor. It allows the supervisor to reread its configuration file and then make an update for changes to take effect. The function requires certain global variables for it to work and two primary actions are taken in its execution; rereading the configuration file and updating the supervisor with the new configurations.

### Technical Description
##### Name:
reload_supervisor_config

##### Description:
This function is used to reload the configuration file of supervisord. It first reads the configuration file again and then updates it.

##### Globals:
- SUPERVISORD_CONF: This variable stores the path to the configuration file for supervisord.

##### Arguments:
- HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR: This is where the `supervisord.conf` file is located.

##### Outputs:
There is no specific output as this function simply executes commands.

##### Returns:
There is also no specific return value as the function executes commands directly and their success or failure would be reflected in their respective side effects.

##### Example Usage:
```bash
HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR="/etc/supervisor" reload_supervisor_config
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. Always ensure that the correct permissions are granted for the supervisord configuration file ((usually `supervisord.conf`). It should be readable by the application, but not writable to avoid accidental or malicious changes.
2. Consider adding error handling in the event that the configuration file is not found or is not parseable. This could be done by checking the return status of the `supervisorctl` commands ($?).
3. Consider enhancing this function by adding echo statements that display informative messages before and after updating the configurations so users can easily follow along.
4. It is a good practice to use absolute file paths instead of relative ones to prevent potential issues with file locations.
5. To ensure the function doesn't unintentionally modify the global variable, consider passing the configuration directory path as a function argument instead of implicitly relying on the global variable `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR`.
