## `register_source_file`

Contained in `lib/functions.d/prepare-external-deps.sh`

### Function overview

The function `register_source_file` is essentially a source file registration function in Bash. It takes a filename and a handler as arguments and registers them as a source file in a specific directory (`HPS_PACKAGES_DIR`, which defaults to `/srv/hps-resources/packages/src`). It avoids duplicate entries by checking their existence before registration. If the source file already exists it will echo a message stating the file is already registered. If not, it will register the file and handler in the `index_file`.

### Technical description

- **name**: `register_source_file`
- **description**: A Bash function that checks and registers a filename and handler as a source file in an index file found in the `HPS_PACKAGES_DIR` directory, or the default directory if not set. It prevents registering duplicate entries.
- **globals**: [`HPS_PACKAGES_DIR`: A variable for the target directory where the source files are registered. If not set, the default directory is `/srv/hps-resources/packages/src`.]
- **arguments**: [`$1`: Filename to be registered,`$2`: Handler for the file]
- **outputs**: Echoes the action (registration or lack thereof due to duplicates) and the file and handler details.
- **returns**: 0 (when the file is already registered)
- **example usage**: `register_source_file "newfile.sh" "myhandler"`

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Consider adding checks for the validation of arguments provided. For instance, ensuring that they are not null or verifying their format improves robustness.
2. Include error handling for the cases when the target directory cannot be created. This will be helpful for diagnosing potential issues.
3. Using absolute path names can enhance the script's security to avoid any potential relative-path attacks.
4. Inputs should be sanitized to prevent possible injection attacks. For example, if the handler is not securely sanitized, an attacker might manipulate it to execute arbitrary code.
5. Always use the double quotes around variable interpolations to prevent word splitting and glob expansion.
6. Implement clear and detailed logging. In addition to the operation result, these logs could include timestamps, user IDs, and more granular details about the operations. This improves traceability and debugging in case of unexpected behavior or errors.
