## `configure_supervisor_services `

Contained in `lib/functions.d/configure-supervisor.sh`

### Function overview

The `configure_supervisor_services` is a Bash function that is responsible for creating a Supervisor services configuration file known as `supervisord.conf`. This function first calls `configure_supervisor_core`, then appends configurations for three programs: `dnsmasq`, `nginx`, and `fcgiwrap` to `supervisord.conf`.

### Technical description

- **name**: configure_supervisor_services
- **description**: Generates a Supervisor services configuration file and appends the setups needed to run three services: `dnsmasq`, `nginx`, and `fcgiwrap`.
- **globals**: [ HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR: A string storing the path to the directory where the Supervisor config files are kept. ]
- **arguments**: None
- **outputs**: A `supervisord.conf` file in the directory specified by `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR`, containing configurations for three services.
- **returns**: None
- **example usage**: `configure_supervisor_services`

### Quality and security recommendations

1. To avoid any misconfiguration or to handle any non-existent directory paths, the function should be improved by adding error handling logic when updating the `supervisord.conf` file.
2. The function uses global variables, which makes it less portable. The best practice would be to parameterize the function, where the configuration directory (currently represented as the global variable `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR`) can be passed as an argument to the function.
3. It is recommended to add additional logging for each step of the process to provide clarity on the steps undertaken by the function and to assist with troubleshooting, if necessary.
4. Permissions of files should be checked and monitored on the fly. The function uses sensitive directories such as '/var/run/' and '/var/log/'. It should ensure the running script has necessary permissions for these operations.
5. All important output and return codes of each command should be trapped and logged to ensure traceability.
6. Any sensitive data such as passwords or keys, if any, should not be hardcoded in the scripts for security reasons. They should be fetched from secure sources or encrypted files.
