### 3. Quality and security recommendations

- Ensure that the input is properly sanitized and is a string to prevent code injection attacks.
- Consider adding error handling to check the validity of the input. If a non-string or a null/empty string is passed as a parameter, the function should have defined behavior.
- Optional: Make the number of "=" dynamic or user-controllable for flexibility.
- Use clear, descriptive names for your functions and parameters. This helps other developers easily understand and use your code.
- Follow a consistent indentation and formatting structure. This improves readability and allows for easier maintenance.
- Always comment your code. While the function may seem straightforward now, proper commenting can help others understand your thought process and makes it easier for future you and others to maintain and update.
