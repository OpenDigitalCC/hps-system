## AI Use Statement for HPS System Development

### AI-Assisted Development Disclosure

The HPS System project has been developed with assistance from AI language models, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on diverse datasets. This statement provides transparency regarding the use of AI in our development process and explains our licensing decisions.

### Use of AI in Development

AI language models have been utilized throughout the development of HPS System to:

- Generate code implementations for system administration functions
- Provide technical guidance on Linux system administration best practices
- Assist in creating documentation and code comments
- Help structure the project architecture and design patterns
- Debug and optimize bash scripts and system configurations

All AI-generated content has been reviewed, tested, and modified by human developers to ensure functionality, security, and adherence to project requirements.

### Training Data Uncertainty

We acknowledge that the AI models used in development were trained on vast amounts of publicly available data, potentially including:

- Open source code from various licenses (GPL, MIT, Apache, BSD, etc.)
- Technical documentation and tutorials
- Stack Overflow and other technical forum discussions
- Academic papers and technical specifications
- Proprietary code that may have been inadvertently included in training datasets

**Critical Point**: We cannot definitively know what specific code or content was included in the AI's training data, nor can we trace the provenance of any particular suggestion or implementation pattern.

### AGPL Licensing Decision

Given the uncertainty around training data sources and to honor the most restrictive Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) licenses that may have influenced the AI's outputs, we have chosen to license HPS System under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)**.

This decision ensures:

1. **Maximum compatibility** with restrictive copyleft licenses that may have been in the training data
2. **Protection of user freedoms** by ensuring all modifications remain open source
3. **Network use compliance** requiring source disclosure even for network services
4. **Respect for the FLOSS community** by choosing the most protective common license

### Ethical Considerations

We believe in:

- **Transparency**: Being open about our use of AI assistance
- **Attribution**: While we cannot attribute to specific sources, we acknowledge the collective contributions of the open source community
- **Reciprocity**: Giving back to the community through our own AGPL-licensed contributions
- **Continuous improvement**: Reviewing and improving our practices as AI and licensing landscapes evolve

### Future Commitments

As the project evolves, we commit to:

- Maintaining transparency about AI use in development
- Staying informed about evolving best practices for AI-assisted open source development
- Contributing to discussions about ethical AI use in FLOSS projects
- Updating this statement as necessary to reflect changes in our practices or understanding
