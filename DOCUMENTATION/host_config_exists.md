## `host_config_exists`

Contained in `lib/functions.d/host-functions.sh`

### Function overview

The `host_config_exists()` function is a BASH script utility designed to check whether specific host configuration files exist in a designated directory. It takes a Media Access Control (MAC) address as the argument, forms a path to the should-be existing file, and checks if the .conf file indeed exists at the specified location.

### Technical description

- **Name**: `host_config_exists`
- **Description**: This function checks if a configuration file named after the provided MAC address exists in the predefined host configuration directory.
- **Globals**: `HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR`: The directory where host configuration files are stored.
- **Arguments**: 
  - `$1`: MAC address of the host whose configuration file's existence will be checked
- **Outputs**: None, the function doesn't produce any output.
- **Returns**: An exit statuses representing 'true' (if file exists) or 'false' (if file does not exist).
- **Example usage**: 
```bash
if host_config_exists "MAC_ADDRESS_HERE"; then
  # Do something if the file exists
else
  # Do something if the file doesn't exist
fi
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. It's recommended that the content of the `HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR` variable is validated for proper format and security before this variable is put into use in the function to prevent potential directory traversal vulnerabilities.
2. You may want to use full paths to the commands (`[[` and `-f`) to prevent potential issues with PATH hijacking.
3. Make sure that the MAC address format of the `$1` argument is validated before it's used in forming the `config_file` path.
4. This function currently doesn't handle the scenario of when the provided MAC address is empty. Error handling could be added to improve the robustness of this script.
5. Consider using more explicit variable names to increase readability.
6. You might want to return a standardized error code instead of relying solely on the exit status in the script to improve debugging information.
