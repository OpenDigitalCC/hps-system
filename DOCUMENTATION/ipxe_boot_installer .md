Contained in `lib/functions.d/ipxe-menu-functions.sh`

### Function overview

The `ipxe_boot_installer` function in Bash is primarily used to boot a system over the network using iPXE (an open source boot firmware). It takes a host type and a profile as arguments and configures the host for booting. The function is highly versatile with a number of steps including loading host type profiles, getting host type parameters, checking the state of the host, setting the host type and profile, mounting the distribution ISO, checking if the kernel file exists, and preparing the iPXE boot for the operating system installation.

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Be sure to sanitize and validate inputs. This function seems to trust the `host_type` and `profile` parameters without verifying their integrity.
2. Add comments to code snippets that might be hard to understand, providing an insight of what the piece of code is actually doing.
3. Error handling should be improved. Adding more specific error messages can help pinpoint the issue causing the error.
4. Whenever possible, use absolute paths for file or directory references to make sure they are being correctly located.
5. The function deploys a set of commands in EOF which presents potential security issues. Avoid using EOF blocks to construct command sequences where feasible.
