## `export_dynamic_paths`

Contained in `lib/functions.d/system-functions.sh`

### Function overview

The `export_dynamic_paths` bash function is designed for managing cluster configurations in a directory-based manner. The function prioritizes the retrieval and setting of cluster-specific configurations from a specified cluster or, if none is specified, from the currently active cluster. The function primarily modifies global environment settings to adjust to the proper configuration directory paths.

### Technical description

- **Name:** `export_dynamic_paths`
- **Description:** This function exports dynamic variable paths based on a specified cluster name. If no name is specified, it retrieves the name of the currently active cluster. It sets the global variables `CLUSTER_NAME`, `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_DIR` and `HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR` to their respective paths.
- **Globals:** [ `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR`: Path to the base directory where cluster configurations are stored (default: /srv/hps-config/clusters) ]
- **Arguments:** [ `$1`: Name of the specific cluster to use; defaults to the active cluster if not specified ]
- **Outputs:** While this function doesn't print to stdout, it does output error messages to stderr if no active cluster is found and none is specified.
- **Returns:** Returns `0` if the function execution completes successfully. If no active cluster is found and none is specified, it returns `1`.
- **Example usage:**

```bash
export_dynamic_paths "my-cluster" # Example of specifying a cluster
export_dynamic_paths             # Example of using the active cluster
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Make sure to properly clean and validate the input to prevent arbitrary path vulnerabilities.
2. Add more error checking for different corner cases.
3. In cases where no active cluster exists and one isn't specified, consider whether failing quietly (i.e., not exporting any variables) might be a better approach than loudly (i.e., outputting an error and returning `1`). This will depend on how your script uses this function.
4. Consider breaking up functionality into smaller functions to improve readability and ease of testing. For example, retrieving the name of the currently active cluster could be its own function.
5. Document the assumption that cluster configuration directories will have hosts subdirectories. Any deviations from this structure can cause problems.
6. Always verify the existence of directories before using them.
7. Avoid storing sensitive information, such as configuration files, in predictable and globally accessible locations.
