Contained in `lib/functions.d/storage_functions.sh`

### Function overview

The get_device_speed function is a Bash function that tests the read speed of a given device. It uses the `dd` command to read data from the device and direct it to null, then uses `grep` to extract the speed from the output. If the `dd` command fails or no speed can be determined, the function echoes "N/A".

### Technical description

- **Name:** get_device_speed
- **Description:** This function tests the read speed of a given device by utilizing the `dd` command to read data and direct it to null. The speed is then extracted from the output. If the process fails or there is no speed, the function returns "N/A".
- **Globals:** None.
- **Arguments:** 
  - **$1:** dev - The name of the device whose speed is being checked.
- **Outputs:** The function will output the speed of the device being tested in MB/s. If this cannot be determined, it will output "N/A".
- **Returns:** None.
- **Example usage:**
```bash
get_device_speed "/dev/sda"
```
This will output the speed of the device "/dev/sda" or "N/A" if it cannot be determined.

### Quality and security recommendations

1. The function should include input validation to ensure the device exists before attempting to read its speed.
2. The function currently uses `dd` which can be dangerous if used incorrectly. Consider alternative methods of determining device speed that avoid the risk of data loss.
3. Consider adding error handling to catch potential issues during the execution of the `dd` or `grep` commands.
4. If utilized in a script with other functions, consider checking for any potential collisions with the local variable `dev`.
5. It may be beneficial to refactor the function to return an error status code if the speed cannot be determined rather than echoing "N/A".
