## `url_decode`

Contained in `lib/functions.d/hps_log.sh`

### Function overview

The `url_decode` function in this Bash script is used to decode a URL. It replaces every '+' in the URL with a space, and all URL-encoded values with their actual ASCII character representation. In case of a failure to write to a specified log file, it logs an error message.

### Technical description

**Function name:**
`url_decode`

**Description:**
The function decodes a URL where all '+' are replaced with spaces and all URL-encoded values are replaced with their actual ASCII character representations. After the message is decoded, it's sent to syslog and an attempt is made to write it to a specific log file.

**Globals:**
None.

**Arguments:**
- `$1` (string): The URL that needs to be decoded.

**Outputs:**
Formatted messages that are sent to syslog, and attempts to write a specified log file.

**Returns:**
No return value.

**Example usage:**
```bash
msg="$(url_decode "Hello+world%21")"
echo $msg  # prints "Hello world!"
```

### Quality and security recommendations

- **Input Validation:** Always check and validate the input that's passed to the function. In this case, make sure that the URL passed to the function meets your requirements or standards.
  
- **Exception Handling:** Add an else statement to the 'if' condition that checks if the logfile is writable. In the else block, provide instructions on what to do if the logfile isn't writable.
  
- **Logging:** Always log the start and end of the function in addition to logging failure events.
  
- **Security:** Be aware of security issues when working with URL decoding, as users with harmful intentions can use percent encoding to evade security filters with ease.
  
- **Secure Logging:** Ensure logs don't contain sensitive information. If that isn't possible, then make sure that your logs are stored in a secure location and are properly protected.
