##### Function overview

It operates by fetching relevant details from a designated system file, before formatting the output to strip out unnecessary spaces, in the event that device information is unavailable, the function will output "unknown".

##### Technical description
Definition block for `get_device_model()`

- **name**: `get_device_model()`
- **description**: `get_device_model()` is a function that retrieves and prints the model name of a given device. It removes any unnecessary spaces in the model name. If the model name cannot be fetched, it prints "unknown".
- **globals**: None 
- **arguments**: 
  - `$1`: Represents the device identifier 
- **outputs**: It prints the device model name to standard output or prints "unknown" if the model name can't be fetched.
- **returns**: None. The function does not explicitly return a value; the result is printed directly to the standard output.
- **example usage**: 
```bash
get_device_model /dev/sda
```
This command will print the model name of the device `/dev/sda`.

##### Quality and security recommendations

1. It's recommended to validate the input to ensure it's not empty and is a valid device identifier.
2. Avoid using `cat` when you can read files directly into a variable.
3. Errors in the `cat` command are sent to `/dev/null`, thus the user will not be informed about possible issues related to non-existent files or lack of required permissions.
4. The function does not return any status code or error message when a failure occurs. All errors should be handled properly, preferably by returning a unique status code.
5. The function will fail silently if the directory or the file does not exist. It is recommended to check if the file exists before trying to read it.
