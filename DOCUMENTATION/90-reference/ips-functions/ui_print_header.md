This function, `ui_print_header()`, is a utility function designed to print a consistent header style onto the terminal for user-interface purposes.

##### Quality and security recommendations

1. Always ensure that proper input validation is performed before accepting the title argument. This is crucial to prevent injection attacks, as malicious code may be executed if not filtered out.
2. Implement error checking for the argument. This function currently doesn't handle cases where no argument (title) is provided.
3. It would be preferable to avoid using `echo` because it does not always handle special characters well. As a refinement, consider using `printf` or another standard output function that can handle exceptions.
