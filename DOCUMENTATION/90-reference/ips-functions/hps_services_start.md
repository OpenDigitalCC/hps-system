##### Function Overview

The function `hps_services_start` essentially manages the starting of services in a given system configuration.

	- `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR`: Indicates the directory where the supervisor configuration file is stored.
- **Arguments**: No arguments required.

##### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Provide error handling for situations where the config file is missing from the `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR`.
2. Ensure appropriate permissions for the `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR` and the configuration file `supervisord.conf` - it should not be editable/deletable by unauthorized users.
3. To prevent possible service interruptions, add a check verifying if the services started successfully after the execution of `hps_services_start`.
4. Ensure that supervisor services are appropriately configured before trying to start them.
5. Consider informing the user about the status of services after they are started.
6. Follow a strict naming convention for services in the supervisor configuration file.
7. Make sure the function is covered with unit tests that emulate different environments and scenarios.
8. Use an encrypted connection when communicating with the supervisord service to prevent any security breaches.
9. Avoid using shell execution (`supervisorctl -c`) where possible as it poses a security risk due to possible command-injection attacks.
