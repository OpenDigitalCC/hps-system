##### Function Overview

The function `export_dynamic_paths` is a Bash function used to export different environment paths for a specific cluster. It takes at least one argument - `cluster_name`. If no cluster name is given, it would utilize the name of the currently active cluster. 

The base directory defaults to `/srv/hps-config/clusters` unless the environment variable `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR` is present with a different directory. This function then exports differing paths including `CLUSTER_NAME`, `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_DIR`, and `HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR`.

##### Technical Description

- **name**: `export_dynamic_paths`
- **description**: A Bash function which exports environment paths for a specific cluster.
- **globals**: [ `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR`: A global variable specifying base directory. Defaults to `/srv/hps-config/clusters` if not provided ]
- **arguments**: [ `$1`: `cluster_name`, The name of the cluster for which specific paths are exported ]
- **outputs**: Sets the environment variables `CLUSTER_NAME`, `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_DIR`, and `HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR`.
- **returns**: The function returns `1` when there is no active cluster and none is specified. In normal operation, it returns `0`.
- **example usage**:
```
export_dynamic_paths "cluster_1"
echo $CLUSTER_NAME
echo $HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_DIR
echo $HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR
```
This would export the cluster paths for the cluster named "cluster_1".

##### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. This function should validate the input for `cluster_name`, possibly for null, special characters or invalid cluster names.
2. Use stricter condition checking. For example, in the `if` condition that checks whether `cluster_name` is empty, consider checking for a null string or whitespace.
3. Ensure that the directory being referred to in variables exist and has the correct permissions, ensure correct error handling for this.
4. Ensure correct permissions are set on the exported paths to avoid unnecessary access from unauthorized users.
5. Use echo statements or a logging function for more verbose output to aid in debugging.
6. Add more error checking, like checking if changing of the environmental variables succeeded.
