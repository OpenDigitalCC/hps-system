##### Function Overview
The `print_cluster_variables()` function in Bash reads a file containing configuration parameters for a cluster and prints these variables to the standard output. It takes the configuration filename as its only argument. As it processes the file, it skips blank lines and lines beginning with a hash mark (#), which are interpreted as comments. If the file isn't found, the function prints an error message to the standard error and returns 1. Variables are unquoted before they are printed.

##### Technical Description
- **Name**: `print_cluster_variables()`
- **Description**: This function reads a cluster config file, unquotes variable values and prints them to stdout. If the config file is not found, an error message is printed to stderr.
- **Globals**: Not applicable.
- **Arguments**: 
  - `$config_file`: Refers to the name of the configuration file for the cluster, obtained from the function 'get_active_cluster_filename'.
- **Outputs**: This function will output each key-value pair from the configuration file, or an error message if the file does not exist.
- **Returns**: `1` in case of error (if the config file does not exist); no specified return in case of successful operation.
- **Example Usage**:
  ```
  print_cluster_variables
  ```

##### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. Always check that provided input is valid. In the current implementation, a file is considered to be a valid configuration file if it exists, but no check is performed to ensure that it contains valid content.
2. Implement error handling for file operations. Currently, if the config file can't be read for any reason other than nonexistence (such as insufficient permissions), the function might behave unpredictably.
3. Only important outputs are being sent to stdout, whilst messages are being sent to stderr. This differentiates between types of outputs making it easier to redirect and handle all types of outputs effectively.
4. Document the function thoroughly: Though the function has a simple and clear name, it would be beneficial to add comments in the code to clarify what it does, how it should be used and what kind of inputs/outputs it expects/deals with.
