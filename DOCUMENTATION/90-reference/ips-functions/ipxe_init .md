##### Function Overview

The function `ipxe_init()` initializes iPXE for network booting. This function is triggered only when the cluster is already configured and we do not yet know the exact MAC address of the host. The function effectively works by sending requests to a URL, attempting to fetch and load a config file, and then executing this config. If no config file can be found, the script displays an error message and reboots. However, this scenario should not occur as the boot manager creates the configuration file.

##### Technical Description

- **Name**: `ipxe_init`
- **Description**: This function is used for initializing iPXE for network booting by trying to fetch and load a server-side provided configuration. This function is only applied when the environment has been set up and the MAC address of the host has not been determined.
- **Globals**: [ `CGI_URL`: The URL which generates the network booting configuration based on a specified MAC address and boot action command ]
- **Arguments**: none
- **Outputs**: The function will output a request to `config_url` and the configuration status after attempting to load it. If no host config is found, it will output an error message and execute a system reboot.
- **Returns**: No specific return value
- **Example usage**: 

```bash
ipxe_init
```

##### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Comment unexplained code: There are several parts of the function (#|| goto no_host_config, #:no_host_config) that are commented out. If this code is not required, it should be removed. Otherwise, the functionality of this code should be clearly explained in comments.
2. Implement error handling: The function should be able to handle error situations more gracefully. For example, the function could try alternative ways to fetch and load the config file if the initial attempt fails.
3. Security improvements: Ensure that the URL fetched from the `CGI_URL` variable is a trusted source to prevent potential security risks.
4. Implement logging: The function could incorporate logging to record any issues which occur during the execution. This would assist with effective debugging and problem resolution.
5. Follow naming conventions: All variable names should adhere to a consistent naming convention. This increases readability and maintainability.
