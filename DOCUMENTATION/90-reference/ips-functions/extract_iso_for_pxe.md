##### Function Overview

The `extract_iso_for_pxe` function is designed to extract ISO files for network booting via PXE. The function accepts four parameters: a CPU type, a manufacturer ID, an operating system name, and its version. It assumes that the ISO files are stored in a specific directory structure, and uses this information to construct the path to the ISO file and the path to the desired extraction directory. If the ISO file is not found, an error is reported. If it has already been extracted, a success message is displayed. If not, the ISO file is extracted to the directory. If the extraction fails, an error is reported, otherwise a success message is displayed.

##### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Add validation of input arguments to check for potential invalid or malicious input.
2. Implement error handling to make the function more robust against potential failures.
3. Secure the directories that the function has write access to, to prevent unintended modification or deletion of files.
4. Test the function in various environments to ensure compatibility.
5. Document the requirements for the ISO directory structure and extraction directory structure to ensure correct usage.
