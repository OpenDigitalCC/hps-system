##### Quality and security recommendations

1. Make sure variable `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR` is defined before running the function as it is not checked or declared inside the function.
2. Consider validating if the directories and files specified by the `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR` and `SUPERVISORD_CONF` variables exist or are writable before attempting to create or modify them.
3. Adding error handling or logging in case of unsuccessful operations such as file creation or writing could enhance the reliability of the function.
4. Check that the configuration files for the individual services are all in the correct format and contain the expected entries to avoid potential errors when they are loaded.
