##### Function Overview 

The `generate_ks` function is primarily used in the generation of a kickstart file for system installations. This function sets numerous environment variables based on the given MAC ID and host type, retrieves several configuration options such as IP, netmask, hostname, and others, and it makes these variables available for the installation script. After setting up all these configurations, it changes the state of the host configuration to "INSTALLING" and finally outputs the installation script by rendering its template.
