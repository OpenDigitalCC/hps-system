##### Function overview

The BASH function `get_device_bus_type` is designed to return the bus type for a given device. The function identifies if the device is NVMe, SSD, or HDD. It does this by first checking if the device is a NVMe type. If it isn't, it checks if the device is SSD. If it's still not identified, the function defaults to identifying the device as HDD.
