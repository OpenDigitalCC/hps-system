##### Function overview
The `host_network_configure` function is responsible for facilitating network configuration on a host machine. It leverages identifiers such as the network macid and hosttype alongside existing network parameters such as the DHCP_IP and DHCP_CIDR retrieved from the cluster configuration. The function also checks if `ipcalc` is installed and then gets the netmask and network base using the `ipcalc` tool to further utilize in network configuration. It immediately exits with an error status if any of the needed configurations are missing or if the `ipcalc` tool is absent.

##### Technical description
###### Name
`host_network_configure`

###### Description
This function is used to configure the network settings of a host machine in a cluster.

###### Globals 
 - `DHCP_IP`: IP address in the DHCP configuration
 - `DHCP_CIDR`: CIDR block details in the DHCP configuration

###### Arguments
 - `$1`: MAC ID of the host need to be configured
 - `$2`: The type of the host, such as master or worker 

###### Outputs
This function does not produce any explicit output. It exerts its effect by changing the network configuration of the host.

###### Returns
This function will return `1` when certain necessary configurations are not found or the `ipcalc` command is not present on the host machine.

###### Example usage
`host_network_configure "mac-address" "host-type"`

##### Quality and security recommendations
1. Consider adding validation steps for MAC ID and host type.
2. Ensure that sensitive information in logs such as MAC ID or IP addresses is protected and not exposed.
3. `ipcalc` dependency should be checked early in installation or startup scripts to reduce the runtime failures.
4. Explicit error handling can be introduced for potential errors during command execution.
5. More robust return codes should be used to indicate different error scenarios.
