Function signature: c4f4f433c7e18e128366307bf60133a4e18e81d677c586a39bfe81ef13c6d637

##### Function overview

`set_active_cluster()` is a Bash function that sets a target cluster as an active one in the system. It checks if the provided cluster name corresponds to an existing cluster directory and if there is a configuration file within the said directory. In case of successful validation, it creates a symbolic link to denote the active cluster.

##### Technical description

- **name**: `set_active_cluster`

- **description**: This function sets a specific cluster as "active" by creating a symbolic link in the base directory. It performs validations to ensure the existence of the cluster directory and configuration file.

- **globals**: [ `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR`: The base directory where all clusters and their configurations reside ]

- **arguments**: 
    [ 
    `$1: cluster_name` - Specifies the name of the target cluster to be set as active
    ]

- **outputs**: Prints error messages to stderr if validation fails. In case of success, prints an acknowledgement message to stdout with the name of the set active cluster.

- **returns**: Returns 1 if the cluster directory does not exist, 2 if the configuration file `cluster.conf` is not found, and implicitly 0 by default if the operation is successful.

- **example usage**: `set_active_cluster "my_cluster"`

##### Quality and security recommendations

1. Provide better handling for failure conditions. This includes more verbose output for error messages and setting return codes for different types of failures.
2. To ensure the usage of this function is safe, the validation could be extended to ensuring the user has appropriate permissions to create the symbolic link.
3. Consider validating the contents of the `cluster.conf` file to ensure integrity and applicability of settings.
4. Care should be taken to properly quote variables to prevent issues with whitespace or special characters in filenames.
5. Avoid global variables if not needed (like `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR`), use function arguments to provide required information.
