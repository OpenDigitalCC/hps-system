##### Function Overview

The `initialise_host_scripts()` function in Bash scripting performs a series of operations. It starts by declaring and initializing two local variables, `gateway` and `distro`, which are used to acquire respective information from the `get_provisioning_node` and `initialise_distro_string` functions. A URL is then constructed utilizing the said variables along with the pre-defined URL structure and stored in `url`. The script then retrieves the script from the URL and places it in a specified destination (`dest`). If the script is successfully fetched, it is sourced; otherwise, it echoes an error message and returns 1.

##### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Incorporate input and output validation: This is a critical practice that assists in mitigating security risks associated with tainted or illegitimate data.
2. Use HTTPS protocol for URL: Using HTTP can expose the script to potential man-in-the-middle attacks. HTTPS should be the default to ensure secure transmission.
3. Add more error checks: Perform checks on the status of the gateway and distro variables and factor in additional handling for potential errors.
4. Enhance logging: To further provide detailed context-specific error and status messages for better debugging, increase logging verbosity.
5. Define a timeout for the `curl` operation: This will prevent the script from hanging indefinitely in cases where the specified URL is facing issues.
6. Avoid global variables: The function does not presently use any, and this should continue to prevent potential conflicts and bugs.
