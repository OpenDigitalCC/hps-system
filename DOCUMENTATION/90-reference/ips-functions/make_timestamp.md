##### Function overview

The presented function, `make_timestamp()`, is used to generate a string representing the current date and time in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The string follows the format: "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss UTC".

##### Technical description

- **Name:** make_timestamp
- **Description:** A bash function that generates a timestamp in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss UTC' using the current date and time in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
- **Globals:** None
- **Arguments:** None
- **Outputs:** Prints the generated timestamp to standard output.
- **Returns:** 0 if the command was successful. Otherwise, it depends on the error code of the `date` command.
- **Example usage:**

##### Quality and security recommendations

1. Avoid storing timestamps in plain text to prevent data leaks. 
2. This function relies on the `date` command's success. There is no error handling if `date` fails. Adding error checking can make the function more robust.
3. To ensure the correctness of the timestamp, it is recommended to synchronize the system clock with a trusted time source. 
4. This function doesn't take any arguments. Although this protects against argument-related security vulnerabilities, the function could be expanded to accept input if flexibility is needed.
