##### Function Overview

The function `ipxe_reboot` is a bash function that is used to log a message about a requested reboot and then perform the reboot after a 5 second delay. It accepts a single argument, which represents the message to be printed before the reboot occurs. It also uses the `ipxe_header` function, although it's unclear from the provided snippet what this function does.

##### Technical Description

- Name: ipxe_reboot
- Description: This function logs a message, prints an additional message, waits 5 seconds, and then triggers a system reboot.
- Globals: `mac`: A global variable that contains the Mac address of the machine. Used in the log message.
- Arguments: `$1: MSG`: A message to be printed before the reboot takes place.
- Outputs: The function outputs several echo commands, including the passed message and the string "Rebooting..."
- Returns: Not applicable, as the function doesn't return a value but causes the system to reboot. 
- Example usage:

```bash
ipxe_reboot "System update completed"
```

In this case, the string "System update completed" is logged and printed before a system reboot is triggered.

##### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. The `ipxe_header` function is invoked without any context or explanation, which may confuse other developers trying to understand the code. It is recommended to clarify its role within this function.
2. This function directly includes the value of `$MSG` within a string that it `echo`s. This has the potential to cause security vulnerabilities, known as Shell Injection, when uncontrolled input is passed as a message. It would be advisable to sanitize this input before rendering it in this way. 
3. Similarly, it appears that the `mac` global variable is used without any validation or sanitization. As this appears to be a Mac address, it would be wise to validate that it fits the expected pattern for such an identifier. 
4. The hardcoded 5 second delay before reboot could be made more flexible. It might be beneficial to allow this delay to be an optional argument to the function, allowing the caller to specify a different time period if needed.
5. There are no checks to ensure that the current user has appropriate permissions to execute a reboot. Checking these permissions before attempting a reboot would improve the stability and error handling capabilities of this function.
