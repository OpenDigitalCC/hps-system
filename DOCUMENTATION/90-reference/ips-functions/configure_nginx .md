##### 1. Function Overview 

The function `configure_nginx()` is a bash function that configures NGINX in a system. It first sources the filename of the active cluster, suppresses any error that might crop, and then sets up the path for NGINX configuration. Lastly, it writes a new configuration into the NGINX configuration file.

##### 2. Technical Description

- `name`: `configure_nginx()`
- `description`: This function sets up the NGINX configurations by sourcing the active cluster file and writing into NGINX configuration file.
- `globals`:  [ `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR`: the directory where the service configuration is stored ]
- `arguments`: [ `$1`: Not applicable in this function, `$2`: Not applicable ]

##### 3. Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Always ensure that the path used in the `source` command is correct to avoid sourcing the wrong file which may lead to problems.
2. Ensure proper permissions for creating and writing to the NGINX configuration file. This is to prevent unauthorized access and modifications.
3. Keep track of the global variables and avoid using them unnecessarily to decrease coupling and increase the function's reusability.
4. Always handle possible errors that may occur during the execution of the function.
5. Always test the function with various inputs to ensure it behaves as expected. Always aim for high test coverage.
6. The function seems to overwrite existing NGINX configuration each time it runs. You should consider preserving and versioning old configurations instead of simply overwriting.
