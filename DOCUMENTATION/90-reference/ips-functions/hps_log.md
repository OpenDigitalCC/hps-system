##### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. Check variable contents: Always check the contents of variables before passing them to this function to avoid any form of command injection or formatting issues.
2. Regular cleanup: Set up a regular cleanup process or log rotation for your log files to avoid them consuming too much disk space.
3. Secure log files: Make sure that the permissions on your log file directory and the log files themselves are set to allow only authorized users to read or modify them. This helps to prevent unauthorized access or modifications.
4. Handle errors: Consider improving this function by including error handling features, such as what should happen if the log file cannot be written to.
