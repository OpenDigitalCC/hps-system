##### Function Overview

The function `configure_dnsmasq` is used to configure the dnsmasq service on a server. Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarding server and DHCP server. It is designed to provide DNS and DHCP services to a small network. It serves and caches the DNS using a /etc/hosts type file and provides DHCP services.

##### Technical Description

- **Name**: `configure_dnsmasq`
- **Description**: The function generates a dnsmasq configuration file based on the active cluster configuration and copies iPXE boot files to a pre-specified TFTP directory.
- **Globals**: [ `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR: Directory where the service configuration files are stored`, `DHCP_IP: DHCP Server IP`, `HPS_TFTP_DIR: Directory for TFTP Server`, `NETWORK_CIDR: Network CIDR for DHCP server` ]
- **Arguments**: None
- **Outputs**:
  If DHCP_IP value is not set, it displays an error message: "[ERROR] No DHCP IP, can't configure dnsmasq". 
  After successful configuration, the message "[OK] dnsmasq config generated at: ${DNSMASQ_CONF}" appears.
- **Returns**: Function exits with status 0 when DHCP_IP isn't set, otherwise it doesn't have a definitive return value.
- **Example Usage**: `configure_dnsmasq`.

##### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. It is recommended to validate the inputs and file handling parts of the function to prevent any potential security risks such as injection attacks or file overwrites.
2. The function should handle the absence of required binaries such as `cat`, `source` and `mkdir`. An error should be thrown if these are not present.
3. Potential failures in the commands within the function should be handled gracefully with meaningful error messages to the user.
4. Return a status code from the function that can be evaluated by the caller to decide the success or failure of the function. This will make it more useful in scripting.
5. It is recommended to use a secure method to store and retrieve the network details instead of sourcing them from a file for more security.
6. Run this script with necessary privileges only, as it can alter system configurations.
