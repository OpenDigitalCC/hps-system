##### Quality and security recommendations

1. Consider validating the inputs (menu item and MAC address) to mitigate unintended behaviors or vulnerabilities in the function.
2. It might be beneficial to define all possible options for the menu item in a list or another manageable construct to enhance the readability and maintainability of the function.
3. Make sure the function components like `ipxe_init`, `ipxe_install_hosts_menu`, etc., that the function depends on, are secure and error tolerant themselves.
4. Consider thoroughly testing this function with different inputs as it seems to have a broad impact on the overall system based on the passed menu item. 
5. As part of secure coding practices, ensure that logging information does not reveal any sensitive or unencrypted system data.
