##### Function Overview

The `int_to_ip` function is a bash function that converts an integer into an IP address format using bitwise shift and bitwise AND operations. It is used in the lower part of the function to convert network, broadcast, gateway IP addresses, and to calculate the start and end of an IP range.

##### Technical Description

- **Name**: `int_to_ip`
- **Description**: This function is used to convert an integer to an IPv4 address. It takes an integer as an argument and calculates each octet of the IP address by shifting the bits of the input integer to the right and then applying bitwise AND operator with 255 to get the value of the octet.
- **Globals**
  - `VAR`: Not applicable
- **Arguments**
  - `$1`: This argument is the integer to be converted into an IP address.
- **Outputs**: This function outputs the equivalent IP address of the input integer.
- **Returns**: Not applicable

  # Output: 127.0.0.1
  ```
##### Quality and Security Recommendations 

1. Ensure to validate the input to the `int_to_ip` function. The function currently assumes valid integer inputs that can be converted into an IPv4 address.
2. Update the function to handle non-integer inputs gracefully. Currently, the function does not check if the input is indeed an integer and can behave unpredictably with non-integer values.
3. Add a return statement in the function to indicate a successful process or failure, which can be useful in error-handling. Currently, the function does not return any status.
4. Improve comments and add inline documentation to enhance code readability and ease future updates or bug-fixing initiatives. The existing comments could be expanded to detail more about what the code is doing.
5. Carefully manage and control access to your scripts to prevent unauthorized viewing or modification, thus enhancing the security of your application.
