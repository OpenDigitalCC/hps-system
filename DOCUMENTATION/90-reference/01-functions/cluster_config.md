Function signature: ea561bb0141a57e976a8d270b800ed25635238facc99a0dcb1b5ee58af4ad106

##### Function Overview

The function `cluster_config()` provides utility for getting, setting, and checking the existence of keys in the active cluster configuration file. It takes in three arguments: the operation type (`get`, `set`, or `exists`), the key whose value to interact with, and optionally, the value to update the key to (for `set` operation).

##### Technical Description

- **Name:**
  `cluster_config()`

- **Description:**
  The `cluster_config()` is a function for managing keys in the active cluster configuration file. It contains operations for getting the values of keys (`get`), for setting the values of keys (`set`), and for checking if keys exist within the file (`exists`).

- **Globals:** 
  None

- **Arguments:** 
  [ `$1`: operation (get, set, exists), `$2`: Key for the operation, `$3`: Optional value for the `set` operation]

- **Outputs:**
  Echoes either the value of the key (for `get` operation), the result of a key existence check (for `exists` operation), or error messages for inappropriate key operation or missing active cluster configuration file.

- **Returns:**
  Returns `1` if no active cluster configuration is found or `2` if an unknown operation is passed.

- **Example Usage:**
  ```bash
  cluster_config get foo
  cluster_config set foo bar
  cluster_config exists foo
  ```

##### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Implement input validation to prevent attempts of injection or any other form of command compromise through the function parameters.
2. Improve error handling by providing more specific error messages and varying the return codes for different error types to assist in troubleshooting.
3. Consider making it more dynamic by allowing interaction with more than one cluster configuration file. 
4. Provide support for other text file formats, or secure the cluster configuration file to prevent unauthorized or unintended modifications.
