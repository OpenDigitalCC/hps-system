##### Function overview

The `host_config` function is a bash function specifically designed to read, write, update, or query entries on a local configuration file identified by a MAC address. It systematically reads a configuration file and stores its key-value pairings in an associative array. After reading the file, the function is able to execute a number of commands ("get", "exists", "equals", "set") based on the arguments provided, on the associative array to manage the configuration entries. Should the command be unknown or absent, the function will return an error. 

##### Technical description

- **Name**: `host_config`
- **Description**: A shell function for managing the configuration of a host identified by its MAC address. It interactively reads, checks, compares, and updates configuration data stored on a local configuration file.
- **Globals**: [VAR: __HOST_CONFIG_PARSED: (boolean) Flag indicating if the Host Configuration File has been parsed, HOST_CONFIG_FILE: the location of the host configuration file, HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR: the directory containing the host configuration file, HOST_CONFIG: (assoc array) Variables parsed from the Host Configuration File. ]
- **Arguments**: 
  * $1: `mac` — the MAC address associated with the host configuration file.
  * $2: `cmd` — the command to execute on the host configuration ("get", "exists", "equals", "set").
  * $3: `key` — the key from the configuration to operate on.
  * $4: `value` — the value to compare or set for the provided key.
- **Outputs**: Depending on the `cmd` argument, it can either:
  * print the value corresponding to the given `key`
  * print a bool indicating if the `key` exists or if the `key` equals the `value` 
  * print logs indicating performed updates
  * print an error message in case of invalid `cmd`
- **Returns**: It could return nothing, or return error code `2` in case of invalid `cmd`
- **Example usage**:
  ```bash
  host_config 00:0a:95:9d:68:16 set VAR Test
  ```

##### Quality and security recommendations

1. Always validate inputs: To ensure the function handles only intended input, add checks to validate the format of the MAC address, and that the `cmd`, `key`, and `value` inputs are not malicious or invalid.
2. Incorporate error handling for file operations: Implement necessary checks regarding file availability, read and write permissions for the config file, and handle errors that might occur during file operations.
3. Add a function documentation: Include a comment block at the beginning of the function to explain its purpose, parameters, return values, and sample usage.
4. Implement detailed logging: Integrate with a logging system to trace every operation performed by this function in a systematic manner. This could greatly simplify debugging and auditing.
5. Check for command success: Add checks to ensure that commands completed successfully and handle any errors that may occur.
6. Use more secure methods for sensitive data: If the configuration data is sensitive, consider using more secure methods to store and handle it, such as encryption and secure file permissions.
