##### Function overview

The `get_iso_path` function is a bash shell function that gets the ISO file path from a specific directory defined by the variable `HPS_DISTROS_DIR`. It checks whether the `HPS_DISTROS_DIR` variable is set and points to a valid directory. If the condition is met, it concatenates `/iso` to the directory path and outputs this new path. If the condition is not met, it outputs an error message and returns a non-zero exit status to indicate the error.

##### Technical description

- **Name**: `get_iso_path`
- **Description**: This function checks if the `HPS_DISTROS_DIR` variable is defined and represents a valid directory. If so, it creates a new path by appending `/iso` to the directory path. If not, it sends an error message to standard error and returns an exit status of 1.
- **Globals**: 
  - `HPS_DISTROS_DIR`: The path to the directory where the ISO file is located.
- **Arguments**: None.
- **Outputs**: 
  - If successful, returns the path of ISO file.
  - If unsuccessful, returns an error message in stderr.
- **Returns**: 
  - Returns 0 if successful (standard for bash functions).
  - Returns 1 if unsuccessful.
- **Example usage**:
```bash
$ get_iso_path
```

##### Quality and security recommendations

1. When dealing with global variables, check their status before using them. A global variable like `HPS_DISTROS_DIR` should be verified for validity not only within this function but also where it is set initially.
2. Error messages should be meaningful and guide the user to resolve the issue. "[x] HPS_DISTROS_DIR is not set or not a directory." is a clear and informative error message.
3. Shell scripts can be risky if not properly handled. Always validate and sanitize the inputs, ensure proper permissions are set, and handle errors gracefully to prevent security vulnerabilities.
4. Adding comments to the function to explain its operation would improve the understandability of the code.
