##### Function overview

The `verify_checksum_signature` is a Bash function that verifies the checksum signature of an ISO file. It checks whether the ISO exists, fetches the checksum file and its signature online, imports the GPG key needed for verification, and then verifies the signature. Finally, it compares the ISO's checksum with the fetched checksum. If the operation successful, it returns 0 and the temp directory is removed; if there is a mismatch or an error occurs, it returns 1 and prints an informative error message.

##### Technical description

Function:

`verify_checksum_signature`

Details:

- **Name:** verify_checksum_signature
- **Description:** Bash function that verifies the checksum signature of an ISO file.
- **Globals:**
  - HPS_DISTROS_DIR: Default directory where ISO files are stored.
- **Arguments:**
  - $1: The target CPU architecture (cpu).
  - $2: The manufacturer (mfr).
  - $3: The name of the operating system (osname).
  - $4: The version of the operating system (osver).
- **Outputs:** Error messages on failure and status messages on success. Delivered through stderr and stdout respectively.

```

##### Quality and Security recommendations

1. Extend the function to support more ISO types rather than just `rockylinux`.
2. Use absolute paths in place of relative paths to guard against path injection vulnerabilities.
3. Check the availability of required utilities (curl, gpg, sha256sum, awk, etc.) at the beginning of the function.
4. Enhance error handling to provide more informative/debuggable error messages.
5. Implement a fallback mechanism for connection failures or temporary unavailability of remote resources.
6. Add a confirmation step before deleting the temporary directory.
7. Test this function with multiple edge-cases and unexpected inputs to ensure reliability.
