##### Function overview
The `configure_supervisor_core` function is primarily used to generate the Supervisor configuration file (`supervisord.conf`). It firstly ensures the existence of the `/var/log/supervisor` directory, which will hold the Supervisor logs. It then sets up a variety of server settings, notably including the server URL, username, password, default logging level, authentication method, etc. After the configuration file is created, it also prints a confirmation message to the user with the location of the generated file.

##### Technical description

- **Name:** `configure_supervisor_core`

- **Description:** This function is designed to generate a Supervisor configuration file (`supervisord.conf`). It defines basic server settings, including network configuration, security settings, logging settings, and more. It'll then save these settings into the configuration file.

- **Globals:** `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR`: The directory that holds the service configuration file of Home Preserving Sweets.

- **Arguments:** This function does not take any arguments.

- **Outputs:** Outputs a confirmation message, confirming the successful generation of the Supervisor configuration file along with its directory location.

- **Returns:** No return value, as the function operates by side effect.

- **Example Usage:** The function can simply be called using `configure_supervisor_core`.

##### Quality and security recommendations
1. It might be more efficient and safer to check the existence of `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR` before the function begins file writing operations.
2. To improve security, it's advised to not hard-code sensitive credentials like username and password in a system configuration file. Instead, consider retrieving them from a more secure place like an environment variable.
3. To standardize the function, it would be better to return specific values to signify the success or failure of the function, useful for debugging and error handling.
4. The function could benefit from better error handling, such as catching if the directory or file fails to create. This may provide a better user experience, and aids with debugging.
5. The `user=root` in the configuration file may make the system vulnerable. It would be better to run the supervisor process with minimal necessary permissions.
