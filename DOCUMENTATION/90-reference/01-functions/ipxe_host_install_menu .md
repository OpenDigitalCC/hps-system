##### Quality and security recommendations

1. Always set up a fail-safe option to catch any unwanted choices or accidental key presses.
2. To ensure security, use an encrypted or secure connection when fetching messages from servers.
3. When using global variables, make sure these do not clash with other existing global variable names.
4. Check the necessity of all globals. If the usage of the global variable can be replaced by local variables or function parameters, opt for those.
5. Provide user feedback whenever critical operations happen like fetching data from server successfully or unsuccessfully.
6. Do not expose critical configuration info or sensitive data in any log or error message.
7. If possible, consider implementing some sort of menu item validation to ensure the selected option is a valid one.
