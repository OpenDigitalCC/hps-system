Function signature: cce7eb1544681966ec11d5f298135158497fc2ac56c89b00c63c84b8e1bc733a

##### Function Overview

The provided Bash function, `cgi_header_plain`, is used to send a plain text HTTP header to the client. This informs the user agent that the content that follows will be in plain text format. It does so by first delivering the `Content-Type: text/plain` MIME type header, then sending an additional echo statement to insert a newline. This effectively separates the headers from the subsequent content.

##### Technical Description

The `cgi_header_plain` function can be broken down into the following components:

- **Name:** `cgi_header_plain`
- **Description:** This function generates a plain text HTTP header to notify the client that the upcoming content will be in the plaintext format.
- **Globals:** None
- **Arguments:** None
- **Outputs:** `Content-Type: text/plain`
- **Returns:** None 
- **Example Usage:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cgi_header_plain
echo "This is the body of the response."
```
In this example, the `cgi_header_plain` function will output a plain content-type HTTP header, followed by a newline. The echo statement then provides the body of the response text.

##### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. **Input Validation:** Since this function does not accept any arguments and does not handle user-supplied input, there are no input validation concerns in this context.
2. **Error Handling:** Although this function does not perform any actions that might result in an error (like file I/O or network calls), in a more complex function, appropriate error handling should be put in place to handle potential failures.
3. **Documentation:** The function has no inline comments. Although the function is straightforward, consistent inline comments can help to make the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand by other developers.
4. **Security:** This function emits a static response, and therefore does not interface with sensitive data, limiting the potential for security vulnerabilities.
