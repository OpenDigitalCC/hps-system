##### Function overview 

The function `count_clusters` is designed to count the number of clusters within a specified base directory. Initially, it offers an error message if the specified directory cannot be found. On recognizing the directory, the function utilizes a shell option to prevent errors if no files were found. It aggregates the relevant cluster directories into an array. If no clusters are found, the function provides an appropriate error message and returns 0. If clusters are identified, their count is printed out.

##### Technical description

- **Name**: count_clusters
- **Description**: This function counts the number of cluster directories within a specified base directory.
- **Globals**: [ HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR: It is the path to the configuration base directory for the clusters ]
- **Arguments**: [ There are no arguments used in this function ]
- **Outputs**: Prints out the total number of clusters found within the base directory, or error messages if a base directory or clusters are not found.
- **Returns**: 0 if base directory not found or no clusters found, otherwise it does not return any explicit value but prints the count of clusters.
- **Example usage**:
    ```bash
    export HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR=/path/to/clusters
    count_clusters
    ```

##### Quality and security recommendations

1. Add proper input validation for the `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR` variable. This would help to mitigate potential issues in the event of unauthorized access or erroneous input.
2. Handle all potential error messages or exceptions for better function robustness.
3. Always ensure that user-provided paths do not allow for path traversal â€“ sanitize the inputs.
4. Use more robust file handling and manipulation commands to explore directories, providing for a more universally applicable function.
