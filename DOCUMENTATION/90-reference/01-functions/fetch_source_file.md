##### Function Overview
`fetch_source_file` is a Bash function that's primarily responsible for managing the download of files in a Linux system. It takes in a URL of a source file as well as a filename. If the filename isn't provided, it infers the filename from the URL. The file is then downloaded and stored in a specific directory. If the file already exists in the directory, it won't re-download it. The function supports the handling of download errors.

##### Technical Description
- **Name**: `fetch_source_file`
- **Description**: This function downloads a file from a given URL and places it in a specific directory. The filename can be manually assigned or automatically inferred from the URL. It also handles cases where the file already exists, by skipping the download, and reports any issues encountered during the download process.
- **Globals**: `HPS_PACKAGES_DIR`: Path to where the packages are stored
- **Arguments**: 
    - `$1`: `url`: URL of the source file to download.
    - `$2`: `filename`: Name of the file to be created. If not provided, the name is inferred from the URL.
- **Outputs**: Status messages to indicate the download process, including whether the file already exists or if the download failed.
- **Returns**: Returns `0` if the file already exists or if the download was successful; returns `1` if the download fails.
- **Example Usage**:
```bash
fetch_source_file "http://example.com/sourcefile.tar.gz"
```

##### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Always use secure protocols (HTTPS over HTTP) to ensure the file is downloaded securely.
2. Validate the URL for the source file before passing it to this function. Ensure it points to a trusted and reliable source.
3. Consider adding a checksum function to verify the integrity of the downloaded file. This could help detect any corrupted or tampered files.
4. Implement robust error handling. While the function handles download errors, it can further be improved to handle other potential failures like issues with directory creation or file saving.
5. Add logs and more verbose outputs for easier troubleshooting.
6. Consider adding testing to validate the correct behavior of the function.
