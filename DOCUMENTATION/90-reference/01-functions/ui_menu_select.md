The function `ui_menu_select()` is used to generate an interactive selection menu in a command-line interface. The function accepts an initial prompt as a primary argument and an array of options.

##### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. It's advisable to include error handling for cases when no options are provided.
2. The function currently allows for any integer input as a valid selection. It would be safer to only accept inputs that correspond to presented options.
3. To improve the robustness, consider limiting the total number of invalid attempts before automatically terminating the function to prevent potential misuse.
4. The function echoes the input which is a potential security risk (Command Injection). Consider revising this for improved security.
