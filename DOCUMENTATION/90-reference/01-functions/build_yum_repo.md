##### Function overview

`build_yum_repo` is a bash function that is used to build a YUM repository in a specified path. It first performs a series of checks to ensure that the provided repository path is valid and that necessary resources are available, specifically the `createrepo_c` command. The function then checks if there have been changes in the RPM files within the repository folder. If there are changes or no previous state, it then executes
`createrepo_c` to generate a new repository. Finally, it saves the current state and logs the success of the operation.

##### Technical description

- **Name:** build_yum_repo
- **Description:** A bash function to build a YUM repository in a specified directory.
- **Globals:** [ HPS_PACKAGES_DIR: The directory where packages for the server are stored, DIST_STRING: String representing the distribution of packages or repository ]
- **Arguments:** [$1: repo_path, path to create the YUM repository in ]
- **Outputs:** Log messages about the process and possible errors.
- **Returns:** 0 if the function successfully ran 'createrepo_c', 1 if the repo path does not exist or wasn't provided, 2 if 'createrepo_c' command wasn't found.
- **Example usage:** `build_yum_repo "$HPS_PACKAGES_DIR/$DIST_STRING/Repo"`

##### Quality and security recommendations

1. One key area of improvement would be to add input validation for the 'repo_path' parameter to ensure it conforms to the expected pattern of a valid path.
2. It would be beneficial to standardize the logging function to output the logs in a consistent format, making it easier to troubleshoot.
3. Implementing error handling logic for the command `createrepo_c --update "$repo_path"` would be beneficial to ensure that the function can recover from unexpected situations or provide useful feedback in case of failure.
4. Security-wise, consider reviewing the permissions and setting restrictive permissions to the .rpm files in the repo_path.
5. Consider using full paths to commands to avoid potential issues with PATH hijacking.
