##### 1. Function Overview

This function, `cluster_has_installed_sch`, checks if there is a Software Configuration (SCH) installed in a cluster. It does this by reading through the configuration files located in a specified directory. If found one with a `TYPE` of `SCH` and a `STATE` of `INSTALLED`, the function will stop inspecting other files and return with a success status (0). If it doesn't find any, it will return with a failure status (1).

- **Arguments:** No arguments needed for this function
- **Outputs:** Prints nothing to stdout.

##### 3. Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Use clear and understandable variable names and add comments to improve code readability.
2. Add error handling to handle cases when the configuration directory does not exist or is not readable.
3. Avoid using globals when possible and pass them as arguments to the function instead. This promotes better encapsulation and reuse of the function.
4. For a more defensive programming approach, validate that config_file actually contains a valid configuration file.
5. Be careful to protect against potential code injections via the `val` or `key` variables when they are being used in other scripts or functions.
