##### Function Overview 

The `fetch_and_register_source_file` function, as the name suggests, does two things. Firstly, it fetches the source file from a given location on the internet. The location is given in the form of a URL. This fetching is performed using another function call - `fetch_source_file`. Secondly, the function registers the fetched file into a local system. The registration is performed using the `register_source_file` function. The filename for the registration process is taken as an optional argument. If it isn't provided, the filename is extracted from the URL.

##### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Input validation is quite crucial. This function should validate the URL before trying to fetch the file from it. It can protect the function from potential security vulnerabilities.
2. The function could incorporate error handling to gracefully handle scenarios when it can't fetch a source file or register it. 
3. Regarding security, it's recommended that the function verify the integrity of the downloaded file. This could be done by checking for a checksum of a file, and ensuring it matches the expected value.
4. One could enhance this function's functionality by returning error codes when it can't fetch a file or register it. The error codes can help determine the error's exact cause.
