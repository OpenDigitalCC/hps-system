Function signature: 1bbd682413f1c35f8f147b598c84f60028eea1205d56405e50b38d7d551b5b01

##### Function overview

The function `get_provisioning_node` is responsible for grabbing and returning the default gateway IP address which corresponds to the provisioning node in a network. It uses the `ip route` command in conjunction with `awk` for parsing the output properly and retrieving the pertinent information.

##### Technical description

**Name**: `get_provisioning_node`

**Description**: This function retrieves and prints the IP address of the default gateway in the network, often called the provisioning node. It is commonly used in networking and system administration scripts for setting up or troubleshooting networks.

**Globals**: None.

**Arguments**: None.

**Outputs**: The default gateway IP address.

**Returns**: Prints to stdout the provisioning node (default gateway IP address), or nothing if the command does not find a default gateway.

**Example usage**:

```bash
$ get_provisioning_node
192.168.1.1
```

In this example, `192.168.1.1` is the IP of the provisioning node.

##### Quality and security recommendations

1. Error Handling: Add error checking to ensure `ip route` command is successful. If the command fails, the function should handle the error and not continue to parse output.
2. Permissions: Ensure the script running this function has appropriate permissions. Command like `ip route` may require higher privileges, it's necessary to control who and how can run the script.
3. Dependency Checks: Check if `awk` is available on the system. This command is critical for the function to work as expected.
4. Privacy Protection: Be cautious about where you output the IP addresses as they may be sensitive information in certain contexts.
5. Code Reusability: This function can be part of a larger library of networking functions to increase reusability and maintainability.
