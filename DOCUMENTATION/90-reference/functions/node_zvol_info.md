### Function Overview

This function `node_zvol_info()` is a bash function primarily used to fetch and display ZFS volume (zvol) information from a specified pool. It accepts themed arguments, `--pool` and `--name`, to determine the pool and the name of the volume, respectively. Once the parameters are provided, it validates their existence, then proceeds to check if the zvol exists in the system. Should all these checks pass, it displays the zvol information—its name, volume size, usage, available space, and reference association —along with its device path.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** node_zvol_info
- **Description:** This function checks specific zvol in the provided zfs pool and name, returns its existence status and displays the zvol information if exists. 
- **Globals:** Remote_log:logs for the remote server.
- **Arguments:** 
  - `$1: --pool`: The name of the ZFS storage pool that contains the ZFS volumes.
  - `$2: --name`: The name of the volume to be checked in the pool.
- **Outputs:** The function prints zvol information to stdout, which includes name, volume size, usage, available space, and references; additionally, it provides the exact device path.
- **Returns:** It returns 1 if there's a failure (invalid/unspecified parameters, or non-existant pool/volume). It returns 0 if it successfully found the zvol and displayed its status.
- **Example Usage:**
```bash
node_zvol_info --pool tank --name volume1
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. Implement more robust error handling. This could include more specific error messages depending on the type of error encountered.
2. Use secure methods when handling the arguments to prevent potential command injection attacks. Escaping or quoting variables can help in this regard.
3. Enhance the logging process. Log all the errors to a specific error log file with timestamps. This will be helpful for debugging purposes if anything goes wrong.
4. Refrain from displaying too much detailed information to unprivileged users. This can be used to gather information for potential attacks.
5. Implement a usage function or comprehensive help menus to assist users in case of syntax confusion or misuse.
