##### Function overview
The `__ui_log()` function in Bash is a utility function designed to generate log outputs. The function captures all function parameters as input, formats them in a specific log output pattern "[UI] {parameters}", and redirects this formatted log to the standard error (stderr) stream. This function is particularly helpful in debugging or tracing execution in scripts due to its concise structure and easy application.

##### Technical description
- **Name:** __ui_log()
- **Description:** A Bash function that takes several parameters, formats them in a standard log output pattern "[UI] {parameters}", and redirects the output to stderr.
    - **Globals:** None.
    - **Arguments:**  [$*]: All arguments are accepted and processed as one string. This characteristic allows the function to take and output an arbitrary list of parameters.
    - **Outputs:** Formatted log "[UI] {parameters}" to standard error.
    - **Returns:** No values are returned.
    - **Example usage:**
        ```bash
        __ui_log "This is a test log entry"
        ```
   This call will print "[UI] This is a test log entry" to the standard error output.

##### Quality and security recommendations
1. Considering the input is directly displayed in a log, ensure that any sensitive data or user data is kept private or obfuscated before invoking the `__ui_log()` function.
2. Add input validation and error handling to ensure calls to `__ui_log()` are working as expected. 
3. Standardize the log output pattern to improve logging efficiency and analysis.
4. Consider redirecting output to a dedicated log file instead of stderr to avoid cluttering the error stream and make logs more manageable.
