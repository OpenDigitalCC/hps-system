The `hps_services_stop` function is a simple bash function in a script that uses the `supervisorctl` command to stop all currently running services under supervision. The services are managed by supervisord, a supervisor process control system. The function works by passing the configuration file located at `$HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR/supervisord.conf` to `supervisorctl` command to control the services.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Check that `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR` is set and exists before using it, to prevent any command injection or path traversal issues.
2. Implement error checking, for example checking whether the `supervisorctl` command was successful or not, and handle any failures gracefully.
3. Avoid running this function with root privileges unless necessary as it can stop all services, which could have unwanted effects.
4. Validate and sanitize all shell inputs, in this case the `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR`, to enforce a tighter security standard and prevent processing unexpected or harmful input.
5. It would be beneficial to log the status messages from supervisorctl for auditing purposes.
