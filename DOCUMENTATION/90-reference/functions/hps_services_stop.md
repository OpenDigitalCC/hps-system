### 3. Quality and security recommendations

1. The function relies on the global variable `CLUSTER_SERVICES_DIR`. It is advisable to validate that this variable is set and points to the right directory for robustness.
2. If necessary, logging should be implemented within the function to capture the status and any potential errors during the execution for debugging and traceability purposes.
3. Ensure proper permissions are set for the scripts containing this function to prevent unauthorized execution or modification.
4. Use secure coding practices like escaping any variables used in the function call to avoid command injection vulnerabilities. In this case, using quotes around `${CLUSTER_SERVICES_DIR}` ensures this variable is safely used even if it contains spaces or other special characters.
5. Make sure `supervisord` and `supervisorctl` are installed, configured correctly, and updated regularly for reliable and secure function execution.
