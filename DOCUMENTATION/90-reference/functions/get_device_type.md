Function signature: c04dccee20f8398f1cc00c1f339464f78c0ea09416025a9627dcbd45477ea68d

### Function Overview

This function, `get_device_type()`, utilizes the `udevadm` command to fetch specific device properties. Given a device ID as a parameter, it queries for properties and filters out the device type. By design, if no correct device ID is given or if the `udevadm` fails, the function defaults to returning "disk".

### Technical Description

- Name: `get_device_type`
- Description: Fetches and returns the type of a device by utilizing the device's unique ID. If a type is not found or the function fails, it defaults to returning "disk".
- Globals: None
- Arguments: [ $1: The unique ID of the device for which the type is to be found ]
- Outputs: The type of the given device. Prints "disk" if no correct ID is given or if the function fails.
- Returns: 0 on successful execution, non-zero on error.
- Example Usage:
```
device_type=$(get_device_type /dev/sda1)
echo $device_type
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. It is recommended to add formal error handling to help diagnose potential issues or incorrect inputs more easily. Relying solely on a default return value can mask actual errors.
2. The usage of `grep` and `cut` to parse the output of `udevadm` assumes a specific output format and might break if the output or format changes in the future. A more robust parser could be considered.
3. All inputs, even if they are supposed to be device IDs, should be sanitized to prevent potential Bash command injection issues.
4. A detailed comment describing the function, its parameters, and its return values can improve maintainability and readability of the code.
