### Function Overview
The Bash function `create_config_dnsmasq` is used for creating and configuring a dnsmasq configuration file. The dnsmasq service is a lightweight network infrastructure tool that provides DNS, DHCP, router advertisement and network boot functions for small networks. The function sources an active cluster filename, sets the configuration file path, checks for the presence of a DHCP IP and generates the necessary settings for the dnsmasq configuration file including PXE/TFTP/DHCP setup, binding specifications, DHCP range generation, DNS configurations, and optional logging and PXE-specific options. If the DHCP IP is not available, an error message is displayed and the function terminates.

### Technical Description
- **name:** create_config_dnsmasq
- **description:** Creates and configures the dnsmasq configuration file based on sourced data from an active cluster and defined global variables.
- **globals:** [HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR: used to define the directory path for the service configuration files, DHCP_IP: used for DHCP IP, DNS_DOMAIN: used for DNS configuration, HPS_TFTP_DIR: used to set tftp root directory, NETWORK_CIDR: used in calculating dhcp-range, DHCP_IFACE: Interface to bind to within the container]
- **arguments:** No arguments used directly by the function
- **outputs:** Logs whether or not the dnsmasq configuration file was successfully generated.
- **returns:** Nothing. Halts execution with exit 0 in case of an absence of DHCP IP.
- **example usage:** 

```bash
create_config_dnsmasq
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. Make sure to sanitise all external inputs to the function to avoid injection attacks.
2. Validate all arguments and parameters used within the function to ensure they are in the correct format and type.
3. Use `set -u` to prevent the script from running if undefined variables are encountered, enhancing stability.
4. Consider breaking down this function into smaller functions for better maintainability and troubleshooting.
5. Implement logging mechanisms to track and identify potential issues during execution.
6. Consolidate the use of echo for error outputs to a central error handling mechanism.
7. Consider iterating over a list of required variables (DHCP_IP etc.) at the start of the function, exiting if any are undefined or empty to ensure the function has all necessary information to proceed.
