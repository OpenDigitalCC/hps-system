Function signature: 5c19d2840751f093e5d235e25b027f015ff8c3397bf8e3295c8f9678f9127911

### Function Overview

This Bash function, named `create_config_dnsmasq`, is used to generate and set up the dnsmasq configuration file for a given active cluster. The generated configuration file supports DHCP and TFTP functionalities, and can be used in a PXE boot environment. The configuration is generated based on active cluster details and is used to set up the working environment, especially when it involves processes such as network booting and assigning IP addresses within the network.

### Technical Description

In deeper details, the function can be broken down as below:

- **Name**: `create_config_dnsmasq`
- **Description**: This function generates and sets up a dnsmasq configuration file for running DHCP and TFTP services.
- **Globals**: These include:
    - `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR`: Description of this variable can be as: The directory path where service config files are stored.
    - `DHCP_IP`: This variable contains the DHCP IP address to bind the dnsmasq service.
    - `NETWORK_CIDR` & `DNS_DOMAIN`: They provide the required network and DNS details for the configuration.
- **Arguments**: The function doesnâ€™t take any explicit arguments ($1, $2, etc.)
- **Outputs**: This function writes out configurations to the dnsmasq.conf file in the `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR` directory. Any errors or issues encountered are logged and signaled.
- **Returns**: No explicit return value, but will exit with 0 in case of an error i.e., when the `DHCP_IP` is not set.
- **Example usage**: It can be called without any arguments like `create_config_dnsmasq`.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. The function should include error checking for every step that might fail, not just checking if `DHCP_IP` is set. 
2. Explicit security measures like directory and file permission setting and verification should exist to ensure that only authorized users can modify or manage these configurations. 
3. It will be better if there's a version history or change tracking for the configuration changes generated by this function.
4. Instead of exiting immediately upon encountering an error, it might be better if the function handled errors more gracefully, allowing for cleanup tasks to complete despite errors. 
5. There might be a need for a parameter validation mechanism to ensure the accuracy and security of supplied values. 
6. Any sensitive information, like IP addresses and domain names, should be handled securely and be secured inside the function to prevent leaks.
