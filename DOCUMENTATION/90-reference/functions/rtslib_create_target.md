Function signature: 05a02a7bcad8e26b1c77c0b01e3325bd5fd95fd6fc531cb13f7285b33082a1df

### Function Overview

The `rtslib_create_target()` function is primarily used to create an iSCSI target. The function establishes the iSCSI target by invoking Python 3 from within a Bash shell, utilizing the `rtslib_fb` Python library with preset attributes and saving them to a file. The iSCSI target is given a name based on the remote_host variable and the current date.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `rtslib_create_target()`
- **Description:** This function creates an iSCSI target by using Python 3 and the `rtslib_fb` Python library. The function takes in a remote host as an argument and creates an iSCSI target name determined by the current date and the provided remote host.
- **Globals:** None
- **Arguments:** 
  - `$1`: The name of the remote host
- **Outputs:** Either creates an iSCSI target or returns a failure message.
- **Returns:** Nothing
- **Example usage:** `rtslib_create_target 192.168.1.15` will create an iSCSI target related to the provided IP address.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Proper Validation: The function should have checks put in place to ensure that the input, in this case, the remote host, is correctly validated and sanitized. This can help prevent any sort of injection or misconfiguration.
2. Error Handling: Increase robustness of the function by putting more specific error handling with clearly defined error messages.
3. Secure attribute setting: Be mindful of the iSCSI target attributes being set here. For example, this function disables authentication (`"authentication", False`), which may not be desirable in a secure setup. Check and review these attribute settings to better suit them to your environment. 
4. Use of globals: This function does not use any global variables which is a good practice in terms of code clarity and avoiding unexpected side effects. However, if any are to be used in the future, they should be carefully managed.
5. Logging: Proper logging techniques need to be followed so that any issue can be debugged effectively. In the absence of effective logging, it will be difficult to trace the issue in the case of any failure.
