Contained in `lib/functions.d/configure-remote-host.sh`

Function signature: f3a19023175709bb6341f62f9bd565ec7430df7cae722dcd18cf2a20800ee478

### Function Overview 

The `initialise_host_scripts()` function in Bash is used to initialize host scripts. It leverages the `get_provisioning_node` function to define the gateway, gathers the distro string through the `initialise_distro_string` function and then forms a URL to fetch a function bundle. The function bundle fetched is downloaded and stored under "/tmp/host-functions.sh". On successful download, the file is then sourced. In case of a failure in fetching the function bundle, the function returns an error.

### Technical Description

- **Name**: `initialise_host_scripts()`
- **Description**: This function is used to initialize host scripts. It fetches the function bundle from a certain URL and downloads it locally. In case of failure in fetching the function, an error is returned.
- **Globals**: [None]
- **Arguments**: [None]
- **Outputs**: This function outputs the status of the operation including the URL from which the function bundle is being fetched, successful or unsuccessful fetching and sourcing of the function bundle.
- **Returns**: This function returns 1 in case of failure in fetching the function bundle.
- **Example usage**:
    ```bash
    initialise_host_scripts
    ```

### Quality and Security Recommendations 

1. Implement a validation check to ensure that the URL is correctly formed and can be accessed. This reduces the risk of script failure due to incorrect URL.
2. Before sourcing the downloaded script, introduce a step to verify its contents. This would protect against downloading and executing malicious content.
3. Consider adding more error handlers in case the functions `get_provisioning_node` and `initialise_distro_string` fail.
4. The destination file path is currently hard-coded which makes the function less flexible. Consider passing the destination file path as an argument.
5. Provide more detailed error messages to improve debugging and user experience.
6. Uses comments for clearer understanding of complexities within the script.
