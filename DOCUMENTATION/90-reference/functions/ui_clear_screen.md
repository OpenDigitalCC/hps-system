##### Function overview

The `ui_clear_screen()` function is designed to clear everything currently visible on the terminal screen. It does this by calling the `clear` command, or if that command isn't available, it uses a printf invocation to send a special sequence (`\033c`) to the terminal that instructs it to clear the screen. This function is typically used to prepare the terminal for presenting a new set of output information.

##### Technical description

- **name**: `ui_clear_screen()`
- **description**: A function that clears all visible content on the terminal screen.
- **globals**: None used in this function.
- **arguments**: This function does not accept any arguments.
- **outputs**: Employs a built-in `clear` command or `printf` to output a special sequence, which leads to the terminal screen becoming blank.
- **returns**: Does not explicitly return any value, but its execution results in either a cleared screen or nothing if both `clear` and `printf` fail.
- **example usage**:
  ```
  ui_clear_screen
  ```

##### Quality and security recommendations

1. Start by adding some error handling for the case where both `clear` and `printf` fail.
2. Clearing the screen may remove valuable information that the user might still need. Consider allowing the user to choose whether they want the screen cleared or not.
3. Always use full paths to binaries (e.g., /usr/bin/printf) to reduce the risk of executing the wrong binary in case a malicious user tampered with system path variable.
4. Include inline comments in complex parts of the function to ensure maintainability.
5. Make sure to test the function in various terminal environments and properly document any differences in behavior.
