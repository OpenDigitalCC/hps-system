### Function overview

The `remote_log` function is a bash function that helps send log messages to a remote server. A given message is first URL-encoded to adhere to a standard format which can be safely transmitted over the web. Once the message is encoded, it's then sent to the remote server using the `curl` command. The function is specifically designed to use POST requests to submit log messages to a bash script on the server side (`cgi-bin/boot_manager.sh`). The function assumes a defined host gateway and uses the `macid` as part of its parameters in sending the POST request.

### Technical description

Function name: `remote_log`

Description: A bash function that URL-encodes a given message and sends a POST request to a remote server to log the message.

Globals: 

- `macid`: Description not provided. Likely an identifier for the machine running the script.
- `HOST_GATEWAY`: The IP address or hostname of the remote server.

Arguments: 

- `$1`: The message to be URL-encoded and logged.

Outputs: 

- No direct output but sends a POST request to the remote server.

Returns: 

- Does not return any explicit value.

Example usage: 

```bash
remote_log "Example log message"
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Implement checks to validate the `macid` and `HOST_GATEWAY` globals to ensure these contain valid values before usage. 
   
2. Include error handling for the `curl` request â€“ the function should be able to handle failures in the HTTP request or provide meaningful error messages.

3. Avoid printing sensitive data in clear text log messages for security reasons. If necessary, obfuscate or encrypt such data.

4. Consider using a standard tool or library for URL-encoding instead of a custom loop to ensure accuracy and efficiency.

5. Consider confirming that the remote haystack service is available and responsive before sending the log message.
