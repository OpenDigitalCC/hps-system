### Function Overview

The bash function named `remote_log` is used to encode a message into URL format and then send it as a log message to a remote server using a POST request.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `remote_log`
- **Description:** This function accepts a string (log message) as an input argument, encodes it into URL format, and then sends it as a POST request to a remote server using `curl`.
- **Globals:** 
  - `HOST_GATEWAY`: the gateway of the host machine. 
  - `macid`: the machine identifier. 
- **Arguments:** 
  - `$1`: The log message to be URL-encoded and sent to the remote server. 
- **Outputs:** Sends a URL-encoded log message using a POST request to a URL specified using `HOST_GATEWAY`, with additional parameters including `macid`.
- **Returns:** None. It only initiates a `curl` POST request but doesn't handle the response.
- **Example Usage:**

```bash
remote_log "This is a log message"
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. URL-encoding should be improved to handle special characters in a more comprehensive and foolproof way.
2. The URL target for the `curl` POST request should be validated to ensure it's well-formed and secure to connect to.
3. Error handling should be added to ensure that the function behaves predictably when things go wrong. For example, handling the case when the message is empty or the target URL refuses connection.
4. The use of global variables could be removed or limited for better code encapsulation and reusability. In scenarios where globals are necessary, they should be validated before use.
5. Secure protocols such as HTTPS should be used instead of HTTP to ensure better security in data transmission.
