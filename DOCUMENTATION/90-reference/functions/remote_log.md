The function `remote_log()` is designed to URL encode a message from the input parameter and send it as a log message to the specified gateway. The log message is sent via a HTTP POST request to a Bash script called `boot_manager.sh` on the gateway host.

- Description: This function takes a message as input, URL encodes the message, and sends a HTTP POST request to send the message to a gateway host.
- Globals: [`macid`: Identifier for the machine, `HOST_GATEWAY`: Address of the gateway host]
- Arguments: [`$1`: the message to be logged and sent, `$2`: Not used]
- Outputs: None, this function does not produce any output.
- Returns: It doesn't return any value.
- Example usage:

##### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. User input should be sanitized before being passed into the function to avoid potential security vulnerabilities.
2. Unused parameters (such as `$2`) should be removed to avoid confusion and maintain cleaner code.
3. Any potential errors from the `curl` command should be handled gracefully. Consider adding error checking to ensure that the message has been sent successfully.
4. Always ensure that the `macid` and `HOST_GATEWAY` variables are properly set and valid.
5. Consider using `https` instead of `http` for the POST request to enhance the security of the function.
