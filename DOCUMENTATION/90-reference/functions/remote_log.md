Contained in `lib/functions.d/kickstart-functions.sh`

Function signature: 1f586056ba1b573eed69d32639c3940c1c742ba73af4aae917a1d65d36c5367c

### Function overview

The `remote_log` function is designed to allow a system to log messages to a remote server. The function initiates by defining a message from its first argument. It then URL-encodes this message in order to safely transmit it to the server. Afterward, a POST request is sent to the specified gateway using curl, containing the URL-encoded message along with some other details.

### Technical description

- **name**: remote_log
- **description**: This function is used to log messages to a remote server. It takes a message as input, URL-encodes it, and then makes a POST request to send the message to a server.
- **globals**: [ macid: This the machine's MAC ID used for addressing, HOST_GATEWAY: This is the remote gateway where the log message will be sent. ]
- **arguments**: [ $1: This is the initial message that will be encoded and sent to the server].
- **outputs**: The function does not explicitly output anything, it sends a POST request with a log message to a remote server.
- **returns**: This function does not return anything.
- **example usage**: `remote_log "This is a test log message"`

### Quality and security recommendations

1. The function does not have any error handling. It would be a good improvement to add some form of error detection and handling, such as checking if the curl command was successful or not.
2. There is a potential security risk with the POST request being sent unsecured. This can be mitigated by using secure protocols such as HTTPS and implementing authentication.
3. The globals `macid` and `HOST_GATEWAY` should ideally be defined in a configuration that can be easily updated, rather than hard-coded into the script.
4. Also consider adding validation for the `message` input to prevent injection attacks.
5. For improved code quality, consider making this function part of a larger library of network functions.
