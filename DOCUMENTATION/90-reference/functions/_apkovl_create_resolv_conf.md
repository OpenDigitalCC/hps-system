### Function overview

The bash function `_apkovl_create_resolv_conf()` aims to create a new `resolv.conf` file in the specified directory with a passed nameserver. It takes two arguments - a temporary directory and a nameserver, creates a `resolv.conf` file in the given directory and logs the process. If the operation fails, it logs an error message and returns 1.

### Quality and security recommendations
1. Input validation: Even though not strictly necessary for this function to work, consider validating inputs, like verifying if a directory exists or if a nameserver is valid.
2. Error handling: Instead of just returning 1, consider throwing an exception or giving a more descriptive error output that includes more details of the issue.
3. Code comments: Including comments in the code would help other developers understand the function better, particularly explaining the purpose of the function and its arguments.
4. Logging: It would be beneficial to include more detailed logging, such as logging the successful creation of the `resolv.conf` file.
5. Security improvement: Be cautious with the use of `echo` with redirection `>` - if not used correctly, it might lead to security vulnerabilities. You should always make sure that user-provided inputs are properly escaped or cleaned up.
