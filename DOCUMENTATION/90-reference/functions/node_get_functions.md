Function signature: eebac83bb5c26396d91804d2a1ab5077611409e260bf91c4091248048eb589de

### Function overview

The `node_get_functions` function in Bash is a tool for sourcing host function bundles. By checking directory contents against a set of patterns and sending file info to the console, it allows for system specifications and appropriate scripts to be identified and executed. 

### Technical description

- **Name:** `node_get_functions`
- **Description:** This function takes in a string specifying the CPU manufacturer and OS details (`distro`), as well as an optional `func_dir` (directory for functions). It then checks for a range of file path patterns within a base directory, reading these files out to the console if they exist. By doing so, it utilizes and modifies host functions based on the given system information.
- **Globals:** `LIB_DIR` (optional)
- **Arguments:** `$1` – CPU manufacturer and OS version info (string of format "cpu-mfr-osname-osver"), `$2` – Optional function directory (string)
- **Outputs:** This function echos host function bundle details and the contents of relevant script file(s) to the console.
- **Returns:** The function doesn’t return a value per se, it operates by side effect (echoing to the console and running scripts).
- **Example Usage:**

```bash
node_get_functions 'intel-manufacturer-linux-3.0' '/path/to/scripts'
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. _Usage information clarification:_ The usage message in this function should be updated to reflect the function's actual name (`node_get_functions` instead of `initialise_host_scripts`).
2. _Input validation:_ Ensure that the `distro` parameter adheres to the expected format before operations are run. Without this, unexpected and potentially damaging behavior could occur.
3. _Error Handling:_ Consider introducing checks or error handling process for directory or file non-existence, rather than relying on nullglob and silently ignoring failures.
4. _Shell Extraction Security:_ Currently, the function uses a construct (`<<<"$distro"`) to put variable data (a user input) into the shell's input stream. This can be a security risk, such as command injection. Consider an approach that doesn't increase this threat.
5. _Hardcoded Path Dependencies:_ To improve robustness and usability across various systems and deployments, consider making path dependencies configurable or passed as arguments, rather than hardcoded.
