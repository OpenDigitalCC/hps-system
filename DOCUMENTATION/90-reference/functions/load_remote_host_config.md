Contained in `lib/host-scripts.d/common.d/common.sh`

Function signature: 7a3ad554ca390fc6c05a7c79d9c40323f388eca53f8e402fc2f7f2adaf358fc0

### Function overview

The load_remote_host_config function is used to obtain configuration data for a host from a remote source via HTTP request. This data is then evaluated and applied to the host.

### Technical description

- **Name:** load_remote_host_config 
- **Description:** This function establishes a connection with a remote host and fetches configuration details required for the host. It uses 'curl' to send an HTTP GET request to the remote host, and 'eval' to evaluate and apply the configuration data that is received from the host.
- **Globals:** None
- **Arguments:** None
- **Outputs:** If the function cannot fetch or load the host configuration, it outputs a log message "Failed to load host config". If debug is enabled, it outputs the fetched configuration with the log message "Remote config: $conf".
- **Returns:** This function will return 1 if there is any error in fetching the configuration.
- **Example usage:**

  ```bash
  load_remote_host_config
  ```
  
#### Code breakdown:
- `local conf` and `local gateway="$(get_provisioning_node)"` are used to declare and initialize local variables. 
- `curl -fsSL "http://${gateway}/cgi-bin/boot_manager.sh?cmd=host_get_config"` is used to fetch the configuration information from the remote host. 
- `remote_log "Failed to load host config"` logs the error message if there is any issue in getting the configuration. 
- `remote_log "Remote config: $conf"` outputs the received configuration for debugging purposes. 
- `eval "$conf"` is used to apply the fetched configuration to the host.

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Use HTTPS instead of HTTP for the curl request to ensure that the data transmission is secure.
2. Verify the integrity of the received configuration data before evaluating it with eval command. Untrusted data can lead to code execution or security breaches.
3. Add error handling for 'get_provisioning_node' function as the function depends on it.
4. The curl command should have timeouts set to prevent the script from hanging indefinitely in case the remote server does not respond.
5. The function should return different error codes for different types of errors - like failure in getting provisioning node or failure in fetching the configuration. This can help in better troubleshooting.
6. Logging should be improved to detail what type of error occurred - whether it is related to network connectivity, server response, etc. for better issue tracking.
