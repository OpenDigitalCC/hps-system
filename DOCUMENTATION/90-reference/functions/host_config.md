### Function Overview

The function `host_config()` is an imperative program in bash scripting language. This function accepts four arguments, namely `mac`, `cmd`, `key`, and `value`. Using these parameters, a configuration file is processed for the host machine identified by the MAC address. The function can execute commands (get, exists, equals, set) on the HOST configuration map, utilizing the `key` and `value` parameters. If the configuration file doesnâ€™t exist or if configuration has not been parsed for the current MAC address, the configuration file is first parsed and the `HOST_CONFIG` associative array is updated with key-value pairs from this file.

### Technical Description

**Name**: host_config()

**Description**: Mainly, this function is for configuring host configuration files which store settings for the host machine identified by the MAC address. Commands to process settings include get, exists, equals, and set. An associative array `HOST_CONFIG` is used for this purpose.

**Globals**: [ HOST_CONFIG: An associative array storing key-value pairs from the host configuration file, HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR: Directory where host configuration files are stored ]

**Arguments**: 
- $1: MAC address identifier for host machine
- $2: Command to process host settings. Valid commands are get, exists, equals, set.
- $3: Key of setting to process.
- $4: (Optional) Value to update the setting with if the 'set' command is used.

**Outputs**: Based on the command:
- get: Prints the value of the setting identified by the key
- exists: Checks if the key exists. No visual output.
- equals: Checks if the setting identified by the key matches the value.
- set: Logs info about the new setting and update.
- A warning if an invalid command is used.

**Returns**: 
- No specific integer return values. For 'get', 'exists', 'equals' commands the function effectively returns 0 (true) if successful and 1 (false) if unsuccessful. 
- For 'set' command no explicit return values are declared.
- Returns 2 if invalid command is supplied.

**Example Usage**:
```bash
mac_addr="00:11:22:33:44:55"
setting_key="Test_key"

# Returns the value of Test_key
host_config $mac_addr get $setting_key
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Strong input validation: Although the function performs some input validation, it could be improved. For example, MAC address format could be validated.
2. Error handling: Currently, if an invalid command is given, the function simply outputs a message and returns 2. Comprehensive error handling here would improve the robustness of the function.
3. Unknown globals: Globals like `HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR` are used in the function without prior validation. It's good practice to check if these are set before usage.
4. Logging: Use a proper logging utility instead of using command-line echo for important operations. Monitoring could also be implemented for security-sensitive operations.
