Contained in `lib/host-scripts.d/common.d/iscsi-management.sh`

Function signature: 747cf8b13f4b0b09cc62797344d4a6efa48f7dd4e42c1431fbc4771d9a4058f5

### Function overview

The `check_iscsi_export_available` function verifies if all necessary software and hardware components are present and correctly set up in order to export iSCSI targets on a Unix-based system. It does this by validating the presence of the `targetcli` package, checking for a properly mounted `configfs` filesystem, and ensuring the availability of Light-weight Input/Output (LIO) kernel target modules.

### Technical description

- **Name**: `check_iscsi_export_available`
- **Description**: This function checks for the presence and configuration of various prerequisites necessary for iSCSI target exporting.
- **Globals**: None
- **Arguments**: No arguments are expected by this function.
- **Outputs**: This function outputs various error or success messages outlining the state of the export environment.
- **Returns**: Returns `0` if all checks pass and the iSCSI export environment is ready (both 'targetcli' and LIO kernel modules are available). Returns `1` and echoes an error message if any of the checks fail.
- **Example usage**: 
```
check_iscsi_export_available
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. To improve soundness and maintainability of the function, it is recommended to implement a more robust error handling mechanism. This might include handling for potential issues during the execution of the embedded shell commands.
2. For security purposes, consider controlling permissions (via 'chown', 'chmod', etc.) on `/sys/kernel/config` to ensure only the required processes and users can access and modify it.
3. To further enhance function reliability, consider adding checks for specific versions of the 'targetcli' package and LIO kernel modules, as different versions may not behave identically.
