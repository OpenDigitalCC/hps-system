### Function Overview

The `generate_rc_script()` is a shell function that dynamically generates a shell script which will update the package repository list of an Alpine Linux system, update its package index, installs bash and curl, and execute a `boot_manager.sh` shell script fetched from a specified gateway. This function is typically utilized in a network boot environment.

### Technical Description

- Name: `generate_rc_script()`
- Description: This function generates a shell script that modifies the package repository list to point to a particular gateway IP address, updates the system's package index, installs bash and curl, and executes a shell script located on the gateway.
- Globals: None.
- Arguments:
  - `$1`: The IP address of the gateway. This IP address is used to point the package repositories and retrieve the `boot_manager.sh` script.
- Outputs: Outputs a shell script that performs the aforementioned actions.
- Returns: None.
- Example usage:
  ```bash
  generate_rc_script 192.168.1.1
  ```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Consider using a secure protocol such as HTTPS for the repository and the `boot_manager.sh` script to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
2. The function could be improved by making it more flexible and allowing the Alpine version and the package list to be defined as variables.
3. Sanity checks for the input argument (IP Address) could be added to ensure it is in the correct format and the targeted server is reachable.
4. Error handling can improve the resilience of the script - for instance, actions could be taken if apk update or the script download fails.
5. Sensitive operations such as changing repositories and executing scripts fetched from the network should be run with minimal privileges to limit potential damage.
