### Function overview

This bash script function, `enable_iscsi_target_reload_on_boot`, checks for the existence of the required iSCSI configuration files, verifies if the `target.service` is installed, and if everything is in place, it enables the iSCSI target to reload its configuration at the system boot. If any of these conditions are not met, it returns an error message and exits with a non-zero status code. 

### Technical description
- Name: `enable_iscsi_target_reload_on_boot`
- Description: This Bash function checks for the required iSCSI configuration files and services, and if found, enables the iSCSI target configuration to reload at system boot.
- Globals: None.
- Arguments: None.
- Outputs: Success or failure message depending on whether the operations were successful or not.
- Returns: The function will return `1` in case of failure (when required files or services are not found) else it will successfully run without explicit return value.
- Example usage: Simply calling the function without arguments is how it is to be used:

### Quality and Security recommendations
1. Input sanitization: Since the function is not currently handling any inputs, this issue doesn't exist in the present case. However, if any arguments are introduced in future versions, be sure to sanitize them.
2. Error handling: It is recommended to handle other potential errors and exit conditions as well. The function currently checks for two potential issues, but other problems may occur.
3. Logging: To see the complete progress of function, you should add more echo statements at different stages. This will offer better debugging ability if something goes wrong in future. 
4. Security enhancements: Validate the required privileges for running the function. In this case, running the script with necessary privileges is crucial for successful operation.
5. You can use more precise tools instead of grep to prevent false positives when searching for the 'target.service'. Do make sure that such tools are installed though.
