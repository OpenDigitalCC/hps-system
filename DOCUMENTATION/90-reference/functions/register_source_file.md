##### Function overview

The Bash function `register_source_file()` takes two arguments: a `filename` and a `handler`. It registers a source file in the `dest_dir` directory by appending the file and handler name to the `index_file`. If the entry has already been registered, an informational message gets printed, and the function returns without making changes. If the destination directory doesn't exist, it gets created automatically.

##### Technical description

- **Name:** `register_source_file`
- **Description:** The function registers a source file in a specific directory designated as `dest_dir`. It avoids duplicate entries and provides feedback messages during the process.
- **Globals:** `[HPS_PACKAGES_DIR: The directory where the packages will be stored. If this variable is unset, the directory '/srv/hps-resources/packages' is used.]`
- **Arguments:** `[$1: The filename to be registered, $2: The respective handler for the incoming file]`
- **Outputs:** Prints messages to standard output indicating whether the file already existed or was successfully registered.
- **Returns:** Returns 0 if the source file is already registered. There is no other explicit return value, so if execution reaches the end , Bash will return the exit status of the last command, which is expected to be 0.
- **Example usage:**
```bash
register_source_file "myFile.txt" "myHandler"
```

##### Quality and security recommendations

1. Input validation: Add checks to ensure the filename and handler are not empty before proceeding with the function.
2. Error handling: Monitor the `mkdir -p "$dest_dir"` and `echo "${filename} ${handler}" >> "$index_file"` statements for possible failures. Exit the function and report an error if these statements fail.
3. Path traversal check: To improve security, check that the filename argument does not contain any directory traversal components like "../" or unexpected special characters.
4. Avoidance of global variables: Instead of using the global variable `HPS_PACKAGES_DIR`, consider adding it as third parameter to the function.
5. Permissions check: Ensure that the script runs with the necessary filesystem permissions to create directories and modify files in the destination directory.
