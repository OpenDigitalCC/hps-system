### Function Overview

The function `configure_kickstart()` is used to generate a Kickstart configuration file for a specified cluster. Kickstart files are used by the CentOS/Fedora/RHEL boot process to configure new installations. It's a shell script that automates the post-installation process of setting up a customized system.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Make sure to validate the input parameter to avoid any unwanted results.
2. Always check for existing files before generating a new file to prevent data loss.
3. Ensure the generated files have the correct permissions and owner to prevent potential security breaches.
4. Consider encrypting sensitive data, such as passwords, to enhance security.
5. Develop comprehensive error handling routines to catch and handle any issues during execution.
6. Avoid using hardcoded values (such as "/srv/hps-config/kickstarts") as much as possible.
