### Function Overview

The `configure_kickstart()` function is designed to generate a "Kickstart" file for a given cluster name. The generated Kickstart file is used to automatically install a Linux operating system on a physical or virtual machine. The function checks if a cluster name is provided, then combines several system configurations and packages into a Kickstart configuration file that can be used to quickly deploy a Linux-based cluster.


### Technical Description

- **globals**: None.
- **arguments**: 
  - *$1*: Cluster name. This argument denotes the name of the cluster which will be installed using the Kickstart file.

### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. Error handling could be improved with more extensive input verification for cluster name before creating files and directories.
2. The script should avoid using hardcoded passwords. A recommended approach might be to use secret management or environment variables to handle authentication.
3. Avoid running applications as the root user. Consider using less privileged users for running applications where possible.
4. There should be a method to update and/or manage packages after the installation. Keeping software/packages updated is an integral part of maintaining the security of the system.
5. It's important to implement logging that can provide insight into the function's operation and make troubleshooting easier. Especially if an issue arises, logs will be crucial in solving it.
