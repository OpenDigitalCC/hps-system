### Function Overview

The `create_config_dnsmasq` function is a helper script designed to create the `dnsmasq.conf` and related configuration files required for dnsmasq functions, like binding to an IP, DHCP reservations, DNS settings, TFTP, and PXE. This function creates and writes the configuration files, and ensures they exist in the specified paths. The function will generate an error message if there is no `DHCP_IP` given.

### Technical Description

* **Name:** `create_config_dnsmasq`
* **Description:** This function creates the `dnsmasq.conf`, `dns_hosts`, and `dhcp_addresses` configuration files for dnsmasq. It also logs the configuration process and checks for the presence of `DHCP_IP`. If `DHCP_IP` is absent, it returns an error message and exits.
* **Globals:** 
  - `DHCP_IP`: description TBD
  - `DNSMASQ_CONF`, `DNS_HOSTS`, `DHCP_ADDRESSES`: Paths for the configuration files
* **Arguments:**
  - Not applicable for this function.
* **Outputs:** Creates the configuration files and logs the process. If `DHCP_IP` is not set, it outputs an error message.
* **Returns:** Technically, as a function, it doesn't return anything.
* **Example Usage:** `create_config_dnsmasq`

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. It is always a good practice to validate input parameters before proceeding with the rest of the function. For this function, more checks could be included to ensure the validity of the supplied IP addresses.
2. Error handling should be improved - currently, if `DHCP_IP` is not set it echos an error line and then exits. It would be better to implement more robust error handling.
3. Avoid using relative paths for configuration files, as this increases the risk of path injection vulnerabilities.
4. Add specific file permissions to the configuration files created using this function. This would restrict unauthorized access to these configuration files.
5. The function currently creates files and logs the process - logging should be considered for all significant steps of the function, not restricted to just the configuration section.
6. The script could benefit from some comments explaining what each section of the created configuration file does.
