### Function overview

The `cgi_auto_fail` function is primarily used to detect the client type and based on the detection, it uses different failure methods. Messages are passed as arguments to the function, and based on the client type, these messages are processed differently. If the client type is `ipxe`, the function `ipxe_cgi_fail` is called; for client types `cli`, `browser`, `script`, `unknown`, the function `cgi_fail` is called; and for all other scenarios, the function simply logs the error and echoes the message.

### Technical description

- **Name**: `cgi_auto_fail`
- **Description**: This function is made to detect the client type and handle failure messages differently based on the client type. The client type is first detected by the function `detect_client_type`, and then care branches deal with the different cases accordingly.
- **Globals**: None
- **Arguments**: 
    - `$1: msg` The failure message to be processed.
- **Outputs**: Depending on the client type and the corresponding branch the execution enters, the output could be the execution of the `ipxe_cgi_fail` function, the `cgi_fail` function, or simply echoing the error message and logging it.
- **Returns**: No specific return value.
- **Example usage**: `cgi_auto_fail "Failure message"`

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Always sanitize user inputs, especially if these inputs are incorporated into messages or logs.
2. Add comprehensive error handling and logging to help with problem detection and troubleshooting.
3. Regularly update your logging methods to take advantage of whatever logging resources are currently available on the system.
4. Separate the logic of error detection from the error messaging to provide a cleaner and more maintainable code.
5. Consider employing a standard and internationalized method for handling error messages.
