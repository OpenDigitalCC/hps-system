### Function Overview

The `cgi_auto_fail()` function is used to automatically fail a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) application. The function uses a local message or uses a default message if none is provided. It detects the client type and fails based on that detection. If the client is `ipxe`, it calls the `ipxe_cgi_fail` function. If the client is `cli`, `browser`, or `unknown`, it calls the `cgi_fail` function.

### Technical Description

- Name: `cgi_auto_fail`
- Description: A function for automated failure of CGI applications. It detects the client type and fails accordingly, using the `ipxe_cgi_fail` for `ipxe` clients and `cgi_fail` for `cli`, `browser`, or `unknown` clients.
- Globals: None
- Arguments: 
  - `$1`: An optional argument. This represents a custom fail message to be used. If no message is provided, a default error message is used.
- Outputs: The function outputs an error message to the shell.
- Returns: Nothing.
- Example Usage: `cgi_auto_fail "Failed to load the webpage.` This will output an error, "Failed to load the webpage," and detect the client type to fail accordingly.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Ensure that input validation is done before calling the function to avoid unexpected results or error messages.
2. Maintain the mappings for failure functions for each client type in one place for easy updates and adjustments.
3. Make sure the function handles all possible client types to ensure robustness.
4. Improve the default error message to provide more context or guidance to the user.
5. When handling errors in web applications, itâ€™s critical to manage the information that you expose to the user. Therefore, ensure that the error information does not expose any sensitive information like system details or user data.
6. Make sure you always update your systems and monitor for any security vulnerabilities or attacks.
