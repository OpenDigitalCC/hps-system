##### Function Overview

The `initialise_cluster` is a Bash function that serves the purpose of cluster initialization. This function takes a cluster name as input, builds a cluster directory path using base directory and cluster name, and creates a cluster configuration file. If no cluster name is supplied, or if the cluster directory already exists, the function halts execution and returns an error. If the initialization process is successful, the function prints a success message to the console, and then calls the `export_dynamic_paths` function to dynamically export cluster paths.

##### Technical Description

**Name:** `initialise_cluster`

**Description:** Initializes a new cluster by creating its directory and configuration file based on the supplied cluster name.

**Globals:** `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR`: The path to the base directory containing the cluster configuration.

**Arguments:** `$1 - cluster_name`: The name of the cluster to be initialized.

**Outputs:** 
- An error message to STDERR if no cluster name is provided or if the cluster directory already exists.
- A message indicating the successful initialization and configuration of the cluster.

**Returns:**
- `1` if no cluster name was provided.
- `2` if the cluster directory already exists.
- `3` if there was an error in exporting cluster paths.
- If the function is successful, it does not explicitly return a value.

**Example Usage:**
```bash
initialise_cluster "my_cluster"
```

##### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. After the cluster directory and file are created, it would be recommendable to set the appropriate permissions to secure these.
2. Always validate user-supplied input, such as the cluster name, to prevent any possible exploits like directory traversal.
3. It's crucial to have error handling at every function call that could potentially fail, like `mkdir` and `cat`.
4. For better readability and maintainability, consider using longer, more descriptive variable names.
5. Make sure to document the globals and their expected values or defaults. The `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR` global is used without any prior default value setting or declaration, which might lead to unexpected behaviour if it's not set in the environment.
6. Be consistent with error reporting. If the function fails at any point, it should be clear to the caller what caused the failure.
