Function signature: 0ec03980bf3af34dd55fa2d767b0fc494f13846b6935087299fd9161e89ab908

### Function Overview

The `initialise_cluster()` function in Bash is used to initialize a new cluster. An individual cluster's records are kept in a directory and the function uses this directory to generate a cluster configuration file (`cluster.conf`). The function accepts an input for the name of the cluster, and checks if that name is present or not. If the cluster name is already in use, the function will return an error. The function will then create the cluster directory and config file. Finally, it invokes `export_dynamic_paths "$cluster_name"`, checks the status of invocation, and if unsuccessful, will generate an error and return.

### Technical Description

- **Name**: initialise_cluster
- **Description**: This function is responsible for initializing a cluster by creating a directory for it and generating a configuration file. If the cluster already exists or if the creation of the cluster fails, the function will return an error.
- **Globals**: [ HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR: Contains the base directory where clusters are stored. Default is set to /srv/hps-config/clusters if not provided. ]
- **Arguments**: [ $1: Name of the cluster to be created, $2: (Not used in current function) ]
- **Outputs**: Prints error messages if the cluster name is not provided, the cluster directory already exists, or if the `export_dynamic_paths()` function fails. Will print success messages when the cluster directory and config file are successfully created.
- **Returns**: Exits with a status of 1 if the cluster name is not provided, 2 if the cluster directory already exists, and 3 if `export_dynamic_paths "$cluster_name"` fails.
- **Example usage**:
  ```
  initialise_cluster "my_cluster"
  ```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Always check that the cluster name is valid and secure, to prevent unintended consequences from directory traversal or other types of injection attacks.
2. Ensure that the base directory is backed up or version-controlled to safeguard against data loss.
3. Consider adding error handling or rollback functions if the cluster creation process is interrupted or fails on different stages.
4. Limit the permissions of the `cluster.conf` file to only those users who need to read or write to it.
5. Regularly review and update the function to meet current best practices and security standards.
