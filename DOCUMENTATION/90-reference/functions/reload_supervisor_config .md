### Function Overview

This is a simple bash shell function named `reload_supervisor_config`. The main aim of this function is to reload the configuration file for the Supervisor process control system. It achieves its objective by first setting the Supervisor configuration file path and then making two calls to supervisorctl with the -c flag, executing 'reread' and 'update' commands respectively. These actions are logged using the `hps_log` function with an "info" flag.

### Technical Description

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Add error checking to ensure the Supervisor configuration file exists before trying to reload it.
2. Handle the potential failure of the 'reread' or 'update' commands, such as by checking `"$?"` after each call to `supervisorctl` and responding accordingly.
3. Improve documentation by adding descriptive comments within the function, detailing what each command does.
4. Consider restricting who has permission to execute this script to limit potential security risks associated with unauthorized changes to Supervisor tasks.
5. Use environment variable expansion `${VAR?}` to ensure required environment variables are set before invoking the function.
