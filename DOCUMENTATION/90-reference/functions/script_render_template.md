##### Function overview

The `script_render_template` function remaps all placeholders in the form of `@...@` with the corresponding values derived from `${...}`. This function uses environment variables and `awk-vars` for its placeholder values: if a placeholder does not exist in `awk-vars`, the value will default to an empty string.

##### Technical description

```
script_render_template
```
 - **Description**: This function remaps all `@...@` placeholders with their corresponding `${...}` values. If a placeholder does not exist in `awk-vars`, it uses an empty string as the default value.
 - **Globals**: None.
 - **Arguments**: None. The function processes all global variables available at runtime and uses them to replace placeholders in the script.
 - **Outputs**: This function will print a string where every placeholder `@...@` has been replaced with the corresponding `${...}` value.
 - **Returns**: This function does not explicitly return a value. However, it prints a line (or lines) with replaced placeholders, which can be used as a return in Bash.
 - **Example usage**:
   ```bash
   VAR1="Hello"
   VAR2="World"
   echo "@VAR1@, @VAR2@!" | script_render_template
   # Output: "Hello, World!"
   ```

##### Quality and security recommendations

1. Use descriptive variable names that accurately reflect the data they hold.
2. Validate all data before using this function to ensure safety and accuracy.
3. Avoid creating global variables unnecessarily, especially if they are only used in this function.
4. Use secure methods for sourcing the variables used in this function, such as exporting only required variables.
5. To avoid unintended script behavior, ensure all placeholders are correctly formatted as `@...@`.
6. Document the usage of this function, as it has implicit dependencies on environment variables.
7. Regularly audit and update the function to maintain its security and reliability.
