Function signature: 2d391e7910d04552e8ca1284295323649c38c44df9d4c9f8e335c080e4d38dac

### Function overview
The `host_network_configure` is a Bash function that configures network settings for a given host. It accepts the MAC address and host type as arguments, and uses these variables to customize the network setup.

### Technical description
**Name:** host_network_configure

**Description:** The function takes in the identifier and type of the host, retrieves the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) IP and CIDR block from the cluster configuration, and configures the network settings accordingly. If the DHCP IP or CIDR block is not present, it logs a debug message and returns 1. It validates the presence of the ipcalc tool required for the configuration process, and if not present, logs another debug message and returns 1. The function calculates the netmask and network base using the ipcalc tool and stores them in local variables.

**Globals:**
- `VAR: dhcp_ip, dhcp_cidr` The DHCP IP address and CIDR block respectively, retrieved from the cluster configuration.

**Arguments:**
- `$1: macid` The MAC address of the host.
- `$2: hosttype` The type of the host.

**Outputs:** Debug messages logged when DHCP IP or CIDR is missing or ipcalc is not installed.

**Returns:** 1 if either DHCP IP or CIDR block is missing from the cluster configuration, or if the ipcalc tool is not installed.

**Example Usage:** `host_network_configure MAC_ADDRESS HOST_TYPE`

### Quality and security recommendations
1. Make sure to keep sensitive network details in secured and protected configurations.
2. Regularly check the status and availability of `ipcalc` tool.
3. Handle the failure case with a meaningful error message instead of simply logging a debug message.
4. Quaternion further error handling for unexpected return values from the `ipcalc`.
5. Check the validity of the received arguments (MAC address and host type).
6. The function should consider validating the retrieved DHCP IP and CIDR block before proceeding with the rest of the function execution.
