### Function Overview

The function `hps_services_restart` is used for restarting the HPS services by configuring, creating and reloading supervisor services. After these operations it logs the restart status and executes post start steps.

### Technical Description

**- Name:** hps_services_restart

**- Description:** This function restarts the HPS services. It starts by configuring and creating supervisor services. Then, it reloads the supervisor configuration. It logs an information message regarding the restart status of all supervisor services, using the configuration file located at "${CLUSTER_SERVICES_DIR}/supervisord.conf". Finally, it performs post start tasks for the HPS services. 

**- Globals:** [ CLUSTER_SERVICES_DIR: This global variable holds the directory where the supervisor services' configurations are stored ]

**- Arguments:** This function does not take any arguments.

**- Outputs:** Logs the outcome of the restart command to the standard output.

**- Returns:** Does not return a value.

**- Example usage:** 

```bash
  hps_services_restart
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Validation checks should be implemented at the start of the function to ensure that the `CLUSTER_SERVICES_DIR` global variable is set and refers to a valid directory.
2. Error handling should be implemented to catch unsuccessful operations, such as in case of failed reload of supervisor configuration or if logging returns an error.
3. Consider using more specific logging levels (e.g., debug, warning, error) instead of using the 'info' level for all types of logs. This makes the system easier to debug and monitor.
4. Carefully manage file and directory permissions for `CLUSTER_SERVICES_DIR` and `supervisord.conf`, ensuring that only authorized users/services can modify them. This can help to prevent unauthorized modification of services, which could lead to security breaches.
5. Evaluate the necessity of executing `hps_services_post_start` at the end of the function in terms of security. If this function is not necessary, or could potentially be exploited, consider removing it.
