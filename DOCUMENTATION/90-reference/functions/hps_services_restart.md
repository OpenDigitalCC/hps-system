##### 1. Function overview

The `hps_services_restart()` function is designed to restart all services under supervision. This function achieves this by first configuring supervisor services using the `configure_supervisor_services` function. Then, it reloads the supervisor configuration by way of the `reload_supervisor_config` function. Finally, it uses the `supervisorctl` command to restart all services, passing the path to the supervisord.conf configuration file via the `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable.

##### 2. Technical description

- **name**: `hps_services_restart`
- **description**: This function is used for restarting all services managed by supervisor. It first sets up supervisor services, reloads the configuration, and then restarts all services.
- **globals**: [ `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR`: It is a global variable that points to the directory holding the Supervisor services configuration file ]
- **arguments**: None.
- **outputs**: Initializes and restarts all supervisor services. Any output (such as error messages) would come from the internals of these commands, sent either to stdout or stderr.
- **returns**: Return status is dependent on the underlying commands within the function which do not have any specific return value checks or handling mechanism.
- **example usage**: The function can be called directly in the script where it's defined as `hps_services_restart`

##### 3. Quality and security recommendations

1. This function directly restarts all services without performing any checks. It would be better to implement a mechanism to first check the status of the services and then restart only those which are not running properly.
2. Handle possible errors or exceptions from the `configure_supervisor_services`, `reload_supervisor_config`, and `supervisorctl` commands to improve reliability.
3. Avoid use of globals where possible as it might introduce side effects. Prefer to use specific, function-scoped variables.
4. Ensure appropriate permissions and user-level privileges when working with system services. This includes ensuring the right user context when calling `supervisorctl` or other service management commands.
5. Include proper logging mechanisms to track the function execution process for better troubleshooting.
6. Implement return checks or handling mechanisms to manage the function's return status accordingly.
