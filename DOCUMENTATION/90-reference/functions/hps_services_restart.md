### Function Overview

This function, `hps_services_restart`, is responsible for restarting all services under the supervision of the Supervisor program. The process involves four steps:

1. Configuring the services which require supervision.
2. Creating the necessary configuration file for those services.
3. Reloading current Supervisor configurations to apply any changes.
4. Using `supervisorctl`, a control tool for Supervisor, with a configuration file located at `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR/supervisord.conf` to restart all services.

This function is particularly useful when you have made changes to your services or updated them and need to restart them for those changes to take effect.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** hps_services_restart
- **Description:** This function configures, creates the config, reloads the config, and restarts all Supervisor services.
- **Globals:** [ HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR: The directory where the supervisord configuration file is located ]
- **Arguments:** No arguments are expected.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Consider improving error handling to allow for easy debugging. Address every potential point of failure within the function, such as failing to configure services, not being able to create or reload the configuration, and not being able to restart a service.

2. Environment variables like `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR` should be properly isolated and validated to prevent injection attacks.

3. The function does not currently validate the configuration file (`supervisord.conf`). A corrupted or improperly formatted file could lead to undefined behavior or interrupt running services.

4. Document more thoroughly about the dependencies ("configure_supervisor_services", "create_supervisor_services_config", "reload_supervisor_config", and "supervisorctl"). Ensure they are securely coded and follow best practices.

5. Ensure that the user running this function has the necessary permissions to restart these services. Accidentally running this function as an unauthorized user can cause the services to stop working.
