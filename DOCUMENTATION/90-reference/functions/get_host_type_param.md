##### Function overview

The `get_host_type_param()` function in Bash is designed to retrieve a specific parameter from a given host type. This is performed by passing the host type and the parameter key as arguments.

##### Technical description

**Name**: `get_host_type_param`

**Description**: This function retrieves a specific parameter (key) from a given host type (type). The 'declare -n' command is used to create a nameref 'ref' which acts as a reference to the variable with the name given by 'type'. It then echoes the value of the element in 'ref' with the index 'key'.

**Globals**: None

**Arguments**: 
- `$1 (type)`: The name of the host type from which the parameter is to be fetched.
- `$2 (key)`: The key of the parameter to be fetched.

**Outputs**: It prints the value of the desired parameter onto the stdout.

**Returns**: It does not return anything except for the output printed onto stdout.

**Example usage**: 

```bash 
  declare -A serverA=("os"="linux" "ip"="192.168.1.1")
  get_host_type_param serverA "os"  # this will output "linux"
```

##### Quality and security recommendations

1. Avoid using the function's arguments directly in the 'declare -n' command. Instead, validate them first. Bash doesn't prevent the creation of namerefs to readonly variables, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
2. For security reasons and to ensure correct fetching of indexed array elements, always quote the keys when using them to access associative arrays.
3. Make sure to error-check the existence of the array and the specific key before trying to access it, to prevent uncontrolled output.
4. Consider applying a variable naming convention in order to prevent conflicts between global and local variables which might cause erroneous behavior.
5. Lastly, remember to encapsulate the function body with curly braces `{}` for readability and maintainability.
