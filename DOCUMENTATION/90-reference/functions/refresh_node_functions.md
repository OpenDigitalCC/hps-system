### Function Overview

`refresh_node_functions` is a Bash function that updates the node functions in a server's local library. This is done by getting the provisioning node IP address and constructing a URL to download the updated functions from. If the download is successful, the function refreshes the local node functions and reloads them in the current shell.

### Technical Description

**Name**: `refresh_node_functions`

**Description**: This function is designed to refresh the local node functions on a server by downloading them from a provided URL. It first determines the provisioning node, constructs the URL for the functions file, checks that necessary directory exists and, if successful, downloads the functions file, and reloads it within the same shell the function was run from.

**Globals**: [ `provisioning_node`: Stores the provisioning node IP address, `functions_url`: Holds the fully formed URL from where the functions will be downloaded ]

**Arguments**: No Arguments are taken by this function

**Outputs**: Status messages and potential error messages are output to the terminal. May output either a success message("Successfully refreshed node functions from... ") or one of two error messages ("Could not determine provisioning node", "Failed to download functions from... ")

**Returns**: The function will return 1 on encountering an error in determining provisioning node or downloading functions. Will return 0 upon successful completion.

**Example usage**: 
```bash
refresh_node_functions
```
### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Consider adding validation to check if the provisioning node and URL are in the correct format before making the request.

2. Examine the potential for integrating error handling to catch and handle any curl download failures more gracefully.

3. Always ensure that sensitive data, such as IP addresses, are not exposed within error messages.

4. Consider utilizing HTTPS instead of HTTP to enhance the security of your download.

5. Bears ensuring the server you are downloading the functions from is trusted to prevent malicious code execution.

6. Verify if the required directory `/srv/hps/lib` has correct permissions assigned to prevent any unauthorized access.
