Function signature: 7207d6053d7feea7b49e85e1ac6488ca00a74177aae1bc317d07cf6d8e044fd0

##### Function Overview

The function `get_active_cluster_filename()` is a Bash function designed to get the name of the active cluster file in a specific configuration directory. At the core, the function uses a symlink pointing to an 'active cluster'. If the symlink or the target doesn't exist, error messages are printed to STDERR and the function returns a status of 1. If everything is successful, the function echoes the absolute path of 'cluster.conf' in the active cluster directory.

##### Technical Description

- **Name**: get_active_cluster_filename
- **Description**: This Bash function returns the path to 'cluster.conf' in the active cluster directory. The 'active-cluster' is a symlink residing in the HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR that points to the active cluster directory. The function handles cases where there is no symlink at the location or if the symlink couldn't be resolved.
- **Globals**: [ HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR: A string containing the base path to the configuration directory ]
- **Arguments**: None
- **Outputs**: If successful, function echoes the absolute path of 'cluster.conf' in the active cluster directory. Otherwise, printing error messages to STDERR.
- **Returns**: On failure, returns 1
- **Example usage**: `get_active_cluster_filename`

##### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Implement additional error checking and handling. For instance, validate that `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR` contains a valid directory path.
2. Avoid storing or retrieving sensitive information without adequate protections in place. If the cluster configurations contain sensitive information, ensure they're secured.
3. Implement symlink protection measures to mitigate symlink attacks like race conditions. Attacks could potentially change symlink destinations.
4. Provide more informative error messages that wouldn't leak potentially sensitive information about the file system to unauthorized users.
5. Handle SIGINT (Ctrl+C) event to clean up intermediate outputs or state and exit gracefully.
