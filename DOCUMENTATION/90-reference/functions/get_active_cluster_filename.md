Contained in `lib/functions.d/cluster-functions.sh`

Function signature: 7207d6053d7feea7b49e85e1ac6488ca00a74177aae1bc317d07cf6d8e044fd0

### Function Overview

The `get_active_cluster_filename` function is designed to return the path to `cluster.conf` in the active cluster directory. If it cannot find an active cluster directory, it returns an error. The function uses a local link variable to the location of the cluster configuration base directory, checks if the link is a symbolic link, and if it is, it resolves the full path to the target of the symbolic link. After resolving the path, it then concatenates the target with `cluster.conf` and returns.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `get_active_cluster_filename`
- **Description:** This function checks for an active cluster directory and should return the path to the `cluster.conf` file located within it. If the directory or file does not exist, it returns an error.
- **Globals:** [ `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR`: Base directory path of cluster configurations ]
- **Arguments:** [ None ]
- **Outputs:** The path the `cluster.conf` within the active cluster directory. If the active cluster directory does not exist, an error message detailing the absent symlink is printed to stderr.
- **Returns:** 0 if successful, 1 if unsuccessful.
- **Example Usage:**
```
path_to_active_cluster=$(get_active_cluster_filename)
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    # handle error
fi
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Input validation: This current implementation does not include checks to validate input, as it does not have any arguments. If any arguments are added later, they should be validated before usage to prevent unwanted behavior.
2. Failure handling: Error messages are sent to stderr, which is a good practice. These messages aid in identifying the source of the error when the function is not able to return the expected output.
3. Documentation: Documenting the behavior of the function (especially in error scenarios) in a comment block above the function can be helpful for the those who use the function.
4. Security: Check if the resolved path (`target`) is under the desired directory path to avoid any symlink attacks.
5. Globals: Avoiding the use of global variables in favor of function parameters can enhance the function's reusability and reduce potential naming conflicts.
