### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. To improve readability and maintainability, consider adding comments explaining what each command does.
2. It's good practice to test return values directly in `if` statements rather than relying on `|| return 1` expressions.
3. We should validate user inputs where possible, and handle errors explicitly.
4. Consider using a variable to capture the error message string, which would allow you to change the message in just one place if needed.
5. Make sure to use secure coding practices, such as not making assumptions about input data, checking for null or unexpected values, and handling errors and exceptions as much as possible.
