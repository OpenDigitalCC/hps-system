Function signature: 7a7e2ac879b38f493155a8d7ebe4e0938b6b76af6dd4451359927f5afb697e52

### Function overview

The `ip_to_int()` function is designed to convert a string representation of an IP address into its corresponding integer value. This is useful for certain networking operations or calculations where integer values for IP addresses are more efficient or easier to use than their string equivalents.

### Technical description

- **Name**: `ip_to_int`
- **Description**: Converts a string representation of an IP address (in the format "X.X.X.X") into an integer representation. The conversion operates by bit-shifting the octets of the IP address and adding them together.
- **Globals**: None
- **Arguments**: `$1: IP address string in the format "X.X.X.X"`. The IP address to be converted.
- **Outputs**: Prints the integer representation of the input IP address.
- **Returns**: None
- **Example Usage**: 

```bash
$ ip_to_int "192.168.1.1"
// Output: 3232235777
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Input validation: To improve robustness, the function should validate the input string to verify it is a well-formatted IP address. This can help to prevent unexpected behavior that may result from incorrect inputs.
2. Error handling: To improve reliability, the function should include error handling to manage circumstances where the input IP address string cannot be correctly converted to an integer representation.
3. Documentation: The addition of inline comments would make the function easier to understand and maintain. This could include explanations of what each operation in the function does, and why it is necessary.
4. Security: Consider the implications if this function is exposed to user input. It doesn't perform any security-sensitive operations internally, but be aware of how it's data is used. High numeric values might overflow in some contexts.
