### Function Overview

The `ip_to_int()` is a bash function which takes a single IPv4 address as a string in its standard dotted decimal notation (for example '192.0.2.1'), and converts it into its corresponding 32-bit integer representation.

### Technical Description

The following is a detailed breakdown of the function and its components.

- **Name**: `ip_to_int()`
- **Description**: This function parses an IPv4 address and outputs it as a 32-bit integer. It uses bitwise shift operators to move each octet to its correct position in the 32-bit number.
- **Globals**: None used
- **Arguments**: A single argument is expected, `$1`, which represents the IPv4 address to be converted.
- **Outputs**: The function echoes the 32-bit integer representation of the given IP address.
- **Returns**: The function does not specifically return any value, but its command status will be 0 if it executes successfully and a non-zero value if it fails.
- **Example usage**: `ip_to_int '192.168.1.1'`

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Error Checking: There should be validation to ensure that the IP address provided matches the expected format. If an invalid IP address is input, the function will currently output unexpected or incorrect results.
2. Argument Count: The function should verify that exactly one argument has been provided. If multiple arguments are provided, unexpected output may be returned.
3. Usage of Global Variables: As of now, the function does not have global variables. But if there is a need for them in the future, try to limit the use of global variables as they potentially affect all parts of a program, not just the function itself.
4. Exit Status: The function should provide more expressive exit statuses for different types of errors, such as invalid IP format or incorrect argument number rather than using the default exit status.
5. Command Injection: Although the function does not directly use user input in a command, it still could be vulnerable to command injection if not properly handled. Always sanitize user input.
