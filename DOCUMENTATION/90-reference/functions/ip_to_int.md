### Function overview

The `ip_to_int()` function takes an IPv4 address as a string and computes a 32-bit integer representation of this address. This function can be used to simplify operations and comparisons involving IP addresses. It is important to note that this function only handles IPv4 addresses and will not work for IPv6.

### Technical description

- **Name**: `ip_to_int()`
- **Description**: This Bash function converts a string representation of an IPv4 address into a 32-bit integer. 
- **Globals**: None.
- **Arguments**: `$1: The string representation of an IP address (e.g., "192.168.1.1")`.
- **Outputs**: The function will print the integer representation of the given IP address.
- **Returns**: The function returns 0 upon successful calculation of the integer representation.
- **Example usage**:

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Error Checking: It is recommended to add error checking to ensure the input string is in the correct format.

2. IPv6 Support: Currently, this function does not support the IPv6 protocol. Implementing support for IPv6 addresses would improve the usefulness of this function.

3. Removal of Global Variables: Currently, the function does not use global variables which is good practice.

4. Edge Cases: It is suggested to construct test cases for the script to ensure it behaves correctly under edge conditions or invalid input.

5. Return statements: It's recommended to use explicit return statements to improve the readability and maintainability of the function.

6. Code Comments: The function should be thoroughly documented to increase maintainability.
