##### Function overview

This Bash function `ip_to_int()` is capable of converting an IPv4 address into a corresponding integer. The function uses Internet standard dotted-decimal IPv4 addresses (e.g., 192.0.2.0), splits the IP at its dots, then calculates and prints out the integer representation of the IP. 

##### Technical description

- **Name**: `ip_to_int`
- **Description**: This Bash function inputs an IPv4 address as an argument and converts it into its corresponding integer value using bit shifting and arithmetic expression. The result is returned to STDOUT. 
- **Globals**: None
- **Arguments**: [ `$1`: IP address to be converted in the format of x.x.x.x where 'x' are numeric values ranging from 0 through 255.]
- **Outputs**: The integer value representing the inputted IP address
- **Returns**: Null
- **Example usage**: `ip_to_int "192.0.2.0"` will output 3221225984.

##### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. For safer code, input validations could be carried out, for instance, checking if the IP address is valid before further processing.

2. Consider checking the number of input arguments to ensure the script works with correct data. If no argument (or more than one) is given, the function should inform the user and exit with a non-zero status.

3. Despite the fact that bash handles integer overflows by wrapping around, the function might be subjected to IP addresses whose integer representations are outside the bounds of what can be expressed in 32 bits. It would be safer to monitor or limit this.

4. The function should handle possible interruptions and should be able to clean up or leave a comprehensible state of execution if interrupted.

5. You could potentially improve readability by using more descriptive variable names rather than o1, o2 etc.

6. Although not a security issue, the function could be more flexible by accepting IP addresses in formats other than one single string argument (for instance accepting 4 separate byte arguments).
