### Function Overview

`remote_function_lib` can be described as a "meta" or higher-order function that essentially creates and exports a library of Bash functions. This code block is designed to synthesize a set of functions that can be injected into the pre and post sections of a remote script, affording a greater degree of modularity and reusability in a Bash-based program. Given the comment, this function is apparently a single point of reference for these functions, but there is a suggestion to move it to its own separate file for more organize project structure.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `remote_function_lib`
- **Description:** This function generates functions that are intended to be injected into pre and post sections of a remote script.
- **Globals:** None
- **Arguments:** None. 
- **Outputs:** It outputs the injection functions in a here-document format.
- **Returns:** No values are returned directly from the function.
- **Example usage:** `remote_function_lib`

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. The commenter recommends considering moving this library into its own separate file. This is indeed a good practice, especially in larger codebases, because it can help to modularize the code and improve the overall maintainability of the codebase.
2. The function does not currently accept any arguments. Depending on how flexible the library of functions needs to be, it may be beneficial to add parameters that can customize its creation.
3. While here-documents are a valid and efficient way to create multi-line outputs in Bash, injecting functions in this way could potentially open up security concerns, such as code injection vulnerabilities, depending on how the output is used. It is recommended to carefully sanitize and validate any input that could end up being executed as code.
4. As a general security practice, it may be helpful to add error checking within the function, or even return meaningful error messages if something in function library creation process goes wrong. This could prove to be beneficial in troubleshooting potential issues.
