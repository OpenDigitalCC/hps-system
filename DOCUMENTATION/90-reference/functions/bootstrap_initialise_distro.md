##### Function Overview

`bootstrap_initialise_distro` is a Bash function used to bootstrap initialization for a particular Linux distribution. This process involves setting up the baseline environment for the chosen OS. The function processes the commands from the provisioning server offline, avoiding networking issues and increasing the stability of the overall process.

##### Technical Description

- **Name:** `bootstrap_initialise_distro`
- **Description:** This function takes a MAC address as an input and initializes the desired Linux distribution operating system for the device associated with that MAC address. The initialization process is done offline by transmitting commands from a provisioning server.
- **Globals:** None
- **Arguments:** [`$1`: The MAC address of the target device]
- **Outputs:** The function outputs a Bash script that is sent to standard output. This output can be saved and executed on the target device for initializing the distribution.
- **Returns:** This function doesn't have a return value.
- **Example usage:** 
     ```bash
     bootstrap_initialise_distro "00:1B:44:11:3A:B7"
     ```

##### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. **Input Validation:** Validate the MAC address input to ensure it's in the correct format and not a potential injection attack.
2. **Use of the Local Keyword:** Ensure that variables used within the function are declared with the local keyword to prevent shadowing of variables from the outer scope.
3. **Error Handling:** Implement error handling mechanism to capture any failures during the offline loading of the Bash script from the provisioning server.
4. **Secure Transmission:** Although the initialization process is done offline, ensure the Bash script transmission from the provisioning server is secure to prevent any potential script tampering.
5. **Logging:** Include logging within the function to ensure any errors or issues can be traced post-execution.
