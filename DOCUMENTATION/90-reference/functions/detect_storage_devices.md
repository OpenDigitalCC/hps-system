### Function Overview

The function `detect_storage_devices` is used to identify all available block devices on a system and gather important details such as device model, vendor, serial number, type, bus, size, usage, and speed. This information is collected in a structured format for easy analysis and troubleshooting.

### Technical Description

- **Name**: `detect_storage_devices`
- **Description**: This function detects all block devices in a Linux system and retrieves information of each device including the device path, model, vendor, serial number, bus type, device type, size, usage, and speed.
- **Globals**: None
- **Arguments**: None
- **Outputs**: The function generates a formatted string containing details about all detected storage devices.
- **Returns**: The function doesn't return a specific result â€“ it echoes the output directly, making the output available in the standard output stream.
- **Example Usage**
    ```
    detect_storage_devices
    ```
    The function will deliver an output listing all the storage devices and their relevant details.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Always sanitize input, if any, to prevent any potential code injection attacks.
2. Incorporate error handling to make the function more robust. This can include scenarios wherein the queried device information is not available.
3. Develop a unit test case for the function to ensure its accuracy and validity.
4. Avoid potential command injection by checking names of the block devices before executing commands.
5. Assign meaningful names to the variable to make the code more readable.
6. Document the function usage and its arguments properly for clarity and future reference. If the function's behavior changes, update the documentation timely.
7. Instead of directly accessing hardware related information, consider using system APIs or other safer methods, if available.
8. The function currently prints information to standard output (via `echo`). Instead, consider returning status codes indicating success or failure for greater control over function reactions to specific scenarios.
