### Function overview

This function `extract_iso_for_pxe` is primarily used to extract ISO files to a specific directory for PXE (Preboot eXecution Environment). The function is provided with the architecture, manufacturer, operating system details and version, and it tries to extract the corresponding ISO file if it hasn't been extracted before. If anything goes wrong during the extraction process, an error message is printed and the function returns with a failure code.

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Ensure that the function parameters, especially `iso_dir` and `extract_dir` are properly sanitized to avoid directory traversal attacks.
2. Implement checks for the existence of the `bsdtar` utility before proceeding with the extraction. If `bsdtar` is not found, exit the function early with a suitable return code and message.
3. Perform more robust error handling. For example, it would be helpful to check whether the directory creation was successful before proceeding with the extraction.
4. Consider adding additional checks or accept only whitelisted inputs to reduce possibilities of misuse or error.
5. Input validation can go beyond the file system. For instance, validate the architecture and OS version parameters to confirm they're valid before proceeding.
