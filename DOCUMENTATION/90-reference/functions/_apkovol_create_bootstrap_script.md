### Function overview

The `_apkovol_create_bootstrap_script` function is a bash function responsible for generating a bootstrap script for a temporary directory on an Alpine Linux distribution. It takes three arguments namely temporary directory, gateway IP and the Alpine version and creates a bootstrap script with these placeholders. The function also handles error scenarios robustly using logging infrastructure and returning relevant values to indicate success or failure.

### Technical description

**Name**: `_apkovol_create_bootstrap_script`

**Description**: The function is defined to create a bootstrap script fulfilling a specific sequence of operations. It's a part of a larger set of operations, usually related to preparing an Alpine environment on a temporary directory including configuring Alpine repositories, updating the package index, installing essential packages, and sourcing other necessary functions.

**Globals**: None

**Arguments**:
 - `$1`: Temporary Directory (`tmp_dir`)
 - `$2`: Gateway IP (`gateway_ip`)
 - `$3`: Alpine Distribution Version (`alpine_version`)

**Outputs**: This function does not directly output any value but it does create or manipulate several files in addition to printing logging statements.

**Returns**: This function returns `0` upon a successful execution and `1` on failure.

**Example Usage**:
```bash
_apkovol_create_bootstrap_script "/tmp/dir" "192.168.1.1" "v3.14"
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Robust error handling: The function does well on this front, logging errors and returning failure immediately. It is also careful to validate its input and exit early in case of irregularities.
2. Secure placeholder substitution: In the step where placeholders are substituted, take into account special characters. Use `printf '%q'` to escape special characters to avoid accidental execution.
3. Validate input: Before accepting directory input or creating files inside unvalidated directories, ensure that path traversal attacks are not possible. Sensitizing path inputs helps avoid such scenarios.
4. Network-dependent operations should be segmented and adopt a fail-fast methodology. This is already in place for this function.
5. Variable localisation: Keep the use of local variables where they are known within, rather than using global variables.
6. Permission handling: Ensure that file permissions are properly managed throughout to prevent unprivileged access. The function does handle this, albeit at the last step, which could be too late in some scenarios.
7. Codify constants: For elements such as number of retries, instead of using magic numbers, their meaning could be codified in the form of well-named constants.
