Function signature: 1ad96e9487bac5b94d7eca312662f18392454507c7cddfac5de26d924e922722

### Function overview

The `reload_supervisor_config` function is a bash function created to reload the configuration of supervisord. It first specifies the path to the supervisord configuration file, then uses the `supervisorctl` command with the `-c` option to read this configuration file, before using the same command to update the supervisord system with the new configuration.

### Technical description

- **Name**: `reload_supervisor_config`
- **Description**: This function is responsible for reloading the supervisord configuration. It utilizes `supervisorctl`, a command line utility provided by supervisord, to reread and update based on the given configuration file.
- **Globals**: 
   - `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR`: This is the directory that contains the supervisord configuration file.
   - `SUPERVISORD_CONF`: This is the path to the supervisord configuration file, assembled by concatenating `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR` with `/supervisord.conf`.
- **Arguments**: No arguments required.
- **Outputs**: No explicit outputs. Function performs operations and sends tasks to supervisord.
- **Returns**: Nothing explicitly but based on the tasks it sends to supervisord it determines whether supervisord configuration has been successfully reloaded or not.
- **Example usage**: `reload_supervisor_config`

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Before running the `supervisorctl` commands, the function should check if the `SUPERVISORD_CONF` file actually exists to avoid errors.
2. The function should also check that `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR` is set and not empty before proceeding.
3. Use the `-c` option for `supervisorctl` carefully, as it allows overriding the main configuration file (`supervisord.conf`), which in the wrong hands can lead to potential misconfigurations or disruptions.
4. Implement error handling. For example, catch errors from `supervisorctl` and handle them appropriately, such as logging the error and exiting the function with an error status.
5. As a general rule, avoid storing passwords or other sensitive information in environment variables like `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR`. Use a secure method to handle these credentials, such as a secret manager.
