### Quality and security recommendations

1. All global variables should be properly sanitized and their contents validated to avoid potential code injections or manipulation of expected values.
2. Generally avoid crafting URLs manually, when possible, as it opens up potential for URL manipulation and injection attacks.
3. Place detailed and pertinent comments on critical sections of the code to ensure maintainability and understandability.
4. Parameters passed to the function could be validated - by checking type, format or range - before using them inside the function to make sure they are in expected form.
5. Implement error handling mechanism for the cases when "imgfetch" fails or has an error.
