### Function Overview
The function `ipxe_header()` is a Bash script function that is primarily used to generate a dynamic iPXE script. This function initially sends a PXE (Preboot eXecution Environment) header via a function 'cgi_header_plain', followed by setting some variables such as 'CGI_URL' and 'TITLE_PREFIX' for later use within the iPXE scripts. The main task of this function involves the construction and execution of an embedded 'heredoc' (EOF) shell script. The script is defined to set a log message, fetch an image, and echo relevant cluster and client information.

### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. Sanitize Input and Output: Ensure that all the variables used in the function are properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
2. Error Handlers: Add error handlers to catch failures and ensure that the function behaves as expected in all cases, particularly when fetching the image via 'imgfetch'.
3. Keep URLs and Ports Secure: The function's 'CGI_URL' that is obtained from 'next-server' must be kept secure, as any lapses could potentially open doors to malicious attacks.
4. Be Cautious of Command Injection: Since shell scripts are vulnerable to command injection attacks, it is advisable to use built-in language features that ensure variable expansion does not permit arbitrary command execution.
5. Code Maintainability: Comment the code in a structured manner for increased readability and ease of future maintenance.
