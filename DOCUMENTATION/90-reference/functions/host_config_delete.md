### 1. Function Overview

The function `host_config_delete()` is designed to delete a specified host configuration file. The function accepts the MAC address of a host as an argument. It determines the configuration file corresponding to that MAC address in a predefined directory and deletes it. It logs an informational message if the file was deleted successfully, or a warning message if the file was not found.

### 2. Technical Description

**name:** 
`host_config_delete()`

**description:** 
This function deletes the configuration file of a host identified by a specific MAC address.

**globals:** 
- `HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR`: This is the directory where the host configuration files are stored.

**arguments:** 
- `$1`: This is the MAC address of the host whose configuration file is to be deleted.

**outputs:** 
Informational or warning logs are output depending on whether the operation is successful or not.

**returns:** 
- `0`: if the host configuration file is deleted successfully.
- `1`: if the host configuration file was not found.

**example usage:** 

```bash 
host_config_delete "00:11:22:33:44:55"
```
It will delete the configuration file mapped to MAC address "00:11:22:33:44:55".

### 3. Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Make sure the function correctly handles special characters in the MAC address to avoid unexpected behavior or security issues.
2. The function should check if the 'rm' command succeeded before logging a success message. This would improve the reliability of the logging message.
3. The `HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR` directory should have appropriate permissions set to prevent unauthorized access or modifications.
4. It would be beneficial to sanitize inputs to reduce the risk of code injection or Directory Traversal vulnerabilities.
5. To reduce the possibility of any potential logs forgery, it would be wise to incorporate a secure logging mechanism.
6. Lastly, check the existence of the `$HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR` directory before performing any operation to prevent any unnecessary errors.
