##### Function Overview

The `host_config_delete()` function is primarily used to delete the configuration file associated with a specific host identified by its MAC address. It constructs the configuration file path using the provided MAC address and a global variable representing the directory path. If the file exists, it is deleted and an informational log message is generated, otherwise, a warning message is logged.

##### Technical Description

- **Name**: `host_config_delete`
- **Description**: Deletes a host configuration file associated with a provided MAC address.
- **Globals**: 
  - `HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR`: Represents the directory path where host configuration files are present.
- **Arguments**: 
  - `$1`: Represents the MAC address of the host machine, which is also used as the config file name.
- **Outputs**: Logs an informational message when the configuration file is deleted successfully, else logs a warning message if it fails to locate the file.
- **Returns**: The function returns `0` when the configuration file is deleted successfully and `1` when the file is not found.
- **Example usage**: 

```bash
host_config_delete "fa:16:3e:d7:f2:6c"
```

##### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Always validate inputs: The function should validate the provided MAC address format before proceeding.
2. Sanitize file paths: Consider edge cases where the value of `HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR` could lead to unwanted behavior (e.g., directory traversal attacks).
3. Use `-v` option to run the function in verbose mode: It helps in debugging if any issue arises.
4. Error messages should be specific: This helps in understanding the problem faster in case of errors.
5. Confirm before deleting files: The function currently deletes the file without any confirmation. A prompt for confirmation before deleting any file would be a safer method.
