### Function Overview

The function `print_cluster_variables()` in Bash is used to read and print the variables from a configuration file of a currently active cluster. This function first checks if the config file exists, and if it doesn't, returns an error message and terminates with a non-zero return value. If the config file exists, this function reads every line from it, ignores blank lines or lines starting with the hash symbol (`#`), and prints the rest after removing surrounding quotes.

### Technical Description

- __Name__: `print_cluster_variables()`
- __Description__: This function reads a configuration file for a currently active cluster and prints its variables after removing surrounding quotes. It returns an error and stops execution if the config file doesn't exist.
- __Globals__: No global variables are used.
- __Arguments__: This function doesn't take any arguments.
- __Outputs__: Variables from the cluster's config file. The output is sent to stdout.
- __Returns__: `1` if the config file doesn't exist. Otherwise, the return value is dependent on the final command in the function.
- __Example usage__: `print_cluster_variables`

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. For enhanced security, consider adding additional checks besides the presence of the config file. For example, verifying file permissions or ownership.
2. Always quote variable references to prevent word splitting and globbing. For instance, consider replacing constructs like `$k` with `"$k"`.
3. The function could return a specific non-zero exit code for different types of failures (file not found, permission errors, etc.) to make error handling more specific.
4. To improve readability, consider adding a comment describing what each local variable specifically stores.
5. Consider handling possible errors in command substitutions used in variable assignments (like the call to `get_active_cluster_filename`) for more robust error handling.
