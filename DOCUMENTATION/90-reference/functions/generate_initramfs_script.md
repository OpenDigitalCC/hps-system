### Function overview
The `generate_initramfs_script` function creates a bootstrap script that is executed post-boot. It first ensures that the `/sysroot` directory exists, then writes the RC script content dynamically, using the `generate_rc_script` function, into the file `/sysroot/etc/local.d/hps-bootstrap.start`. It finally gives execution permissions to `hps-bootstrap.start` script and informs the user that the bootstrap script has been installed.

### Technical description
**Function Name:** generate_initramfs_script

**Description:** This function generates a script that executes after boot. It checks for the presence of `/sysroot` directory, then, it dynamically writes the RC script content into a file `/sysroot/etc/local.d/hps-bootstrap.start`, gives it execute permissions and outputs a success message.

**Globals Variables:** None.

**Arguments:** 
- `$1`: Represents the gateway IP address.

**Outputs:** 
1. Success message informing the user of the installed bootstrap script.
2. Error Message if `/sysroot` directory is not found.

**Returns:** Does not return a value. If `/sysroot` directory is not found, the script execution stops with an exit status of 1.

**Example Usage:**
```bash
generate_initramfs_script "192.168.1.1"
```

### Quality and security recommendations
1. Check validity of the input argument: the function should not just accept any argument as IP address. The function should incorporate data sanity checks to ensure that the passed argument is a valid IP address.
2. Use more descriptive error message: when the `/sysroot` directory is not available, consider providing suggestions or possible steps that a user could take to resolve the error.
3. Ensure Secure Coding Practices: practice secure coding to protect against injection and other attacks. For instance, dont't blindly trust the input passed into `generate_rc_script` function.
4. Consider better error handling: rather than just printing output to stdout, consider logging errors to a dedicated error log for better diagnostic and debugging capability.
5. Validate successful execution of commands: rather than just displaying a completion message, ensure that commands were successfully executed before displaying the message or proceed to next command.
6. Keep system and programming practices up-to-date. Regularly check for and apply updates and patches to your systems and coding tools, to maintain pace with evolving threats.
