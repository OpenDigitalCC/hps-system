### Function Overview
The function `bootstrap_initialise_functions()` is a shell script specifically designed for offline bootstrap initialization from a provisioning server. At a high level, this function generates a script containing other functions, using a Here Document (identified by `<<'EOF'`) to output a multi-line string. The generated functions are tailored to suit any distribution, making this script versatile across different platforms. This function is particularly useful when augmenting system functionality or setting up a specific system state offline.

### Technical Description
- **Name:**  bootstrap_initialise_functions
- **Description:** The function is used to initialise functions offline from a provisioning server. It generates a shell script that allows for the augmentation of system functionality in a distribution agnostic manner.
- **Globals:** None
- **Arguments:** None
- **Outputs:** A shell script outputted directly in terminal containing the startup functions necessary for bootstrapping the system in an offline environment.
- **Returns:** Not applicable as the function does not return a specific value but instead outputs a script
- **Example Usage:** 
```bash
# To bootstrap the initialise functions from your terminal
bootstrap_initialise_functions
```
The actual functionality of the generated script will depend on what was written into the Here Document within this function.

### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. Avoid writing sensitive information into the script: As the function outputs a script directly into the terminal, sensitive information such as passwords should not be included in the output generation for security reasons. 

2. Input validation should be implemented: If the function were to be extended to take arguments, rigorous input validation should be performed to avoid potential command injection attacks and ensure correct function operation.

3. Always use the function in a secure environment: Since the function handles system functionality, it should always be executed in a secure and authentic environment. 

4. Ensure secure file permissions: If the output script from this function will be stored as a file, ensure it has appropriate file permissions to avoid unauthorized access.
