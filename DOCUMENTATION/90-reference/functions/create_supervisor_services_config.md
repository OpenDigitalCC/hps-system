### Quality and security recommendations

1. Each function called (`create_config_nginx`, `create_config_dnsmasq`, `create_config_opensvc`) should incorporate error handling to ensure the process of creation indeed occurs without fail.
2. Ensure that the configuration files created by these functions have tight file permissions to prevent unauthorized access or modifications.
3. Implement logging inside each function to have an audit trail of the operations performed and to allow for efficient debugging in case of any issues.
4. Validate the configuration files for nginx, dnsmasq and opensvc after they are created to ensure they do not contain any misconfigurations or security vulnerabilities.
5. Always handle sensitive data (passwords, secret keys, etc.) securely if such data is being written into any of these configuration files. Avoid hardcoding secrets in the scripts or configs and use secure methods to fetch such information.
