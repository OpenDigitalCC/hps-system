### `create_supervisor_services_config `

Contained in `lib/functions.d/configure-supervisor.sh`

Function signature: 000144298c724dfbd327b7354be11dd901d1726a3f593104f6a6bbdb96329588

### Function Overview 

This function, `create_supervisor_services_config`, is responsible for invoking three other functions namely: `create_config_nginx`, `create_config_dnsmasq`, and `create_config_opensvc`. It appears to generate configurations for three different services: Nginx, Dnsmasq, and OpenSVC. The exact nature of these configurations will depend on the implementation details of the respective functions. 

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `create_supervisor_services_config`
- **Description:** This function initiates the creation of configuration for three different services (Nginx, Dnsmasq, Opensvc) by calling their respective functions.
- **Globals:** None used in this function
- **Arguments:** None required for this function
- **Outputs:** Dependent on the outcome of the called functions `create_config_nginx`, `create_config_dnsmasq`, `create_config_opensvc`.
- **Returns:** Nothing explicitly returned but the success of the function depends on the successful execution of the called functions which create the configurations.
- **Example usage:** 

```bash
create_supervisor_services_config
```

This will run each of the three configuration creation functions without any arguments.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Cross-check the structure: It would be helpful to ensure that the three configuration generating functions have been defined before this function is called.
2. Incorporating error handling: Each of the called functions should ideally include error handling capabilities to manage any issues that could occur during their execution.
3. Enhance understanding with comments: Commenting your code will enhance the understanding of how each of the called functions operate.
4. Monitor global variables: Although this function doesn't use any, the functions it calls might alter global variables. Using global variables can make debugging difficult and they should therefore be used sparingly.
5. Validate function outcomes: The function could be improved by validating the outcome of each function call. If any call fails, it should either terminate with an error message or attempt to resolve the issue before proceeding.
