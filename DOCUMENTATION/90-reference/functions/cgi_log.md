##### Function Overview

The `cgi_log` function is a bash function designed to create logs for a cgi program in the ipxe system. This function acquires a message as an input and appends this message to a `cgi.log` file located in the `/var/log/ipxe/` directory. The function also adds a timestamp in front of every message log.

##### Technical Description

**Name:** `cgi_log`

**Description:** The `cgi_log` function takes a message (string input), adds a timestamp to it, and appends it to the `cgi.log` file found in the `/var/log/ipxe/` directory.

**Globals:** None

**Arguments:** `$1: msg` (The message string that is to be logged)

**Outputs:** Appends the timestamped message to a file (`cgi.log`).

**Returns:** Nothing.

**Example Usage:**
```
cgi_log "This is a log message."
```

Last command will append the following log to the `/var/log/ipxe/cgi.log` file:

```
[date in "%F %T" format] This is a log message.
```

##### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Before appending a message to the `cgi.log` file, ensure that the file exists and has the correct permissions to avoid potential file not found exceptions.
2. Validate the input message to prevent logging of potentially harmful scripts or commands.
3. In order to prevent potential log file overflow, implement log rotation strategies.
4. Always make sure to redirect both `stdout` and `stderr` to capture any kind of execution message for full logging.
5. For better security considerations, avoid disclosing sensitive information in the log. Details such as user credentials or personal details should be anonymized or completely left out.
6. It's recommended to wrap this function in a `try-catch` or similar error handling method to handle any possible errors effectively and maintain the stability of your running script.
