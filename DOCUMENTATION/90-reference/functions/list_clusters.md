Function signature: 93e2d81ba91f8f27fd695171a6ba9261942077d5e68bbf9699a91e819f6fdd9e

### Function Overview

The `list_clusters` function is used to identify and list all directories available in a defined parent directory. This is particularly useful in server environments where the content of certain directories can be considered as separate entities or clusters.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `list_clusters`
- **Description:** This Bash function lists all the available directories in a defined parent directory. It accomplishes this by shifting the option to consider missing files as a null string, then, it loads all directories to a local array `clusters`. Thereafter, it reverts the previous option and extracts the basename of all the directories in the array, which it outputs one-by-one.
- **Globals:** `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR`: This is the directory location where the function will search for subdirectories.
- **Arguments:** The function does not require any arguments.
- **Outputs:** The base names of all the directories within `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR`.
- **Returns:** Outputs the names of all the directories in `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR`, one per line.
- **Example Usage:** 

```bash
# Assuming /home/user/directories has subdirectories dir1, dir2, and dir3
export HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR='/home/user/directories'
list_clusters
# This will output:
# dir1
# dir2
# dir3
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Always ensure that `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR` is a valid directory before running the function. A non-existent or typo error can lead to unwanted results or errors.
2. It is recommended to add an error handler in case `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR` doesn't exist.
3. Validate the output of `basename` to ensure that it contains expected values. This could help prevent unintended or erroneous output.
4. The function depends on a global variable `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR` to work as expected, this design increases coupling and might affect maintainability. Consider passing this as an argument.  
5. Write a more descriptive output message to let user easily understand the command output.
