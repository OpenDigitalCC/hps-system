Function signature: 18bbbffc19d9426de745e5b45fe837f9d50ec9443122924bb19421975f877cbc

### Function overview

The `zpool_slug()` function is designed to convert a given string into a slug, suitable for use in URL paths or IDs. This function takes up to two arguments: the string to convert and (optionally) the maximum length of the slug. It converts the string to lower case, replaces any non-alphanumeric characters with a hyphen and removes any consecutive or trailing hyphens. It then truncates the slug at the specified maximum length or at 12 characters if no length was provided.

### Technical description

- **name**: `zpool_slug()`
- **description**: Converts a string into a slug of a specified or default length.
- **globals**: None.
- **arguments**: [ `$1`: The string to be transformed into a slug, `$2`: Maximum length of the slug. This argument is optional, with a default length of 12 if left unspecified.]
- **outputs**: Prints the slug to stdout
- **returns**: None.
- **example usage**: `zpool_slug "Example String" 10` will output `example-str`

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Right now, there is no explicit handling of invalid input, such as non-string values. Adding type checking and error handling for these scenarios would improve robustness.
2. Consider adding input sanitization to prevent any potential security issues (although current implementation is already reasonably safe due to removal of all non-alphanumeric characters).
3. Ensure that maximum slug length is not overly restrictive and take possible unicode characters into account.
4. Write unit tests for this function to guarantee it behaves as expected and validate the slug creation logic.
5. Specify locale in the script to ensure consistent character conversion, as the current implementation uses the locale setting of the running environment which can lead to unexpected results.
