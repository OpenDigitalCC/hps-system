### Function overview

The `ipxe_boot_installer` function is used to install a new host through ipxe boot. The host type and profile are defined as arguments, and these provide the essential configuration for the installation process. Different kernel and initrd files are utilized based on the host type. If the host type is defined as "TCH", then the host is configured for network boot. Else, the host gets configured based on the loaded cluster host type profiles.

The function checks if the host is already installed and aborts the installation if that's the case. After setting the configurations, the function specifies the distribution path and URL, mounts the distro ISO and prepares for PXE Boot for non-interactive installation. The function handles different OSNAME cases and tosses an error if the configuration for the particular OSNAME does not exist. In the end, the state of the host is set as "INSTALLING".

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Input validation - Ensure that the supplied `host_type` and `profile` are valid and not malicious. This is especially important if the inputs are mentioned by an untrusted user or from an untrusted source.
2. Error handling - Add more robust error handling. Currently, if the `$state` fetch from `host_config` fails for any reason, the script continues to execution. This may lead to undesired outcomes or misconfiguration.
3. Log improvements - Including more detailed logging could assist in diagnosing problems or errors during installation.
4. Return codes - Although the function does not currently return a specific code, adding return codes to indicate successful execution or error conditions can be helpful in larger scripts or systems.
5. Code redundancy - There is some repeated code in the `ipxe_boot_installer` function, such as the configuration setting for `host_config`. This could be consolidated to reduce redundancy and improve code maintainability.
6. Configuration check - Additional checks can be configured for verifying the validity of `DIST_PATH` and `DIST_URL`.
