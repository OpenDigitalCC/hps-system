##### Function Overview

The `ipxe_boot_installer` function handles the installation process for a new host based on its type. The function firstly loads server-side profiles for different host types and then retrieves specific parameters needed from these profiles. It also checks if the host is already installed and if it is, the function gets aborted and the host gets a reboot command. Specific host configurations are set and an ISO file containing the distribution of the operating system is mounted. The function supports several operating systems, including Rocky Linux.

##### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. To improve readability of the script, it's recommended to document values and expected outputs of internal function calls.
2. There are few user-oriented error messages. An enhancement would be adding more informative and user-friendly messages.
3. There is a potential security risk as path variables for files and directories are not quoted, thus might lead to command injection vulnerabilities if they contain spaces or special characters. Quoting them could prevent such issues.
4. To increase function modularity, a consideration could be dividing this long script into separate smaller functions.
5. Ensuring regular updates, patches, or security fixes for the operating systems installed on the hosts.
