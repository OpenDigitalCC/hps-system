### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Validate input: Ensure the input string (`$1`) is sanitized and validated before being used to prevent potential script injection attacks.
2. Error handling: Consider adding error handling for the `cgi_header_plain` function.
3. Documentation: Document the purpose and usage of the function in the codebase for easier maintenance and collaboration.
4. Return codes: This function currently does not use explicit return codes. Though it's not integral in this simple function, using return codes can add clarity to the function's behavior, particularly in error states.
