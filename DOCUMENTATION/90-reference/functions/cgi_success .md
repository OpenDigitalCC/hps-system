### Function overview

The `cgi_success` function serves as an auxiliary function for CGI scripting in Bash. It sends a plain text HTTP header and subsequently outputs the first argument to stdout. This function is typically used for sending successful operation messages or other text-based responses in the context of CGI scripting.

### Technical description

Here's a more comprehensive rundown on different components of the `cgi_success` function:

- **Name**: `cgi_success`
- **Description**: The `cgi_success` function calls another function named `cgi_header_plain` to deliver a plain text HTTP header, then it uses `echo "$1"` to print the first argument. This function is commonly used in CGI scripting to deliver successful responses in the form of plain text to the client.
- **Globals**: None.
- **Arguments**: `$1: The string content to be echoed as the response body after delivering the plain HTTP header.` 
- **Outputs**: Outputs the first argument passed to it (the `$1` argument) after sending a plain HTTP header.
- **Returns**: No explicit return value since `echo` does not have one; but, it does output the argument to stdout which could be trapped as a returned response in CGI.
- **Example usage**: `cgi_success "Your operation was successful"`

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Always ensure that the argument provided to `cgi_success` is properly sanitized. This helps to prevent potential HTML injection attacks, as the output of this function can be rendered by a web browser.
2. The function should handle the edge case where no argument is supplied to the function to prevent possibly sending an empty response body.
3. To debug easier, consider logging all received parameters in your existing logging solution prior echo'ing them.
4. The function does not handle any errors or exceptions, it assumes the `cgi_header_plain` function, which is not defined here, executes successfully. Always ensure to handle errors or exceptions that may arise during the execution of the script.
5. The "HTTP/1.0 200 OK" status line (typically returned by the `cgi_header_plain`) should be followed by an extra set of CRLF characters according to the HTTP protocol. Make sure these are handled correctly within the `cgi_header_plain` function.
