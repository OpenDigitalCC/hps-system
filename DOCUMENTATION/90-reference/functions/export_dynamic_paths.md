### Function Overview

This Bash function, `export_dynamic_paths`, is designed to set and export paths dynamically within a cluster server environment. It makes use of local cluster names to base its operation while providing an alternative default directory path. This function is significant for managing multiple active clusters and ensuring that the active cluster is properly recognized. The function also sets and exports environment variables representing various paths in the cluster's configuration.

### Technical Description

- **Name**: `export_dynamic_paths`
- **Description**: A Bash function designed to set and export cluster configuration paths dynamically using the provided cluster name as a reference. This includes the active cluster, the cluster's configuration directory, and the hosts configuration directory. The function also considers the case where an active cluster has not been specified.
- **Globals**: [ `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR`: This global variable provides the root directory for storing cluster configs. By default, its value is set to /srv/hps-config/clusters]
- **Arguments**: 
    - `$1`: This argument is the string value that represents the cluster name. If it is not provided, the function will use the currently active cluster (default to empty string).
- **Outputs**: Outputs a warning message "[x] No active cluster and none specified." to stderr if no active cluster exists and none is specified by user.
- **Returns**: Returns 1 if there is no active cluster and none has been specified by the user, or 0 if execution was successful.
- **Example usage**: `export_dynamic_paths 'cluster_name'`
 
### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. Validate inputs at the start of the function. Be sure that the supplied cluster name does not contain unsafe characters (e.g., slashes, backticks, etc.) that could potentially lead to command or path injection attacks.
2. Handle all error or exceptional scenarios. Improve error handling so that more specific messages are returned based on the failure's nature.
3. Make sure that proper permissions are set for the directories and files involved, especially when the function is handling paths and using these to access potentially sensitive data or system configurations.
4. Incorporate a logging mechanism to trace the function's behavior when debugging is required to aid in future troubleshooting.
5. Use more descriptive variable names for readability and maintenance. Ensure the variable and function names accurately describe their purposes or behavior.
