Contained in `lib/host-scripts.d/rocky.sh`

Function signature: c64e26c5e886b1a0aded061414c66873630e97cae41cf2c7a37f800fd6866674

### Function Overview

This function, `build_zfs_source` is designed to perform several tasks that include building ZFS sources for the Rocky Linux distribution. The steps it follows are quite straightforward. The function retrieves the necessary ZFS source data from a defined URL path, downloads the corresponding file, installs ZFS build dependencies, extracts the source file into a temporary build directory, compiles, and finally, installs it, while logging various parts of the process using the `remote_log` function.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `build_zfs_source`
- **Description:** The function downloads and builds the ZFS source for Rocky.
- **Globals:** None.
- **Arguments:** None.
- **Outputs:** Logs the various steps in the process using the `remote_log` function. Use of this function suggests that the output of this function may be directed to a remote log server or service.
- **Returns:** Returns 0 if the ZFS source is successfully built and installed. Returns 1 if any error occurs at any stage of the process.
- **Example usage:** To use this function, it would be sourced and executed in a Bash shell as follows:
```
. path/to/script.sh
build_zfs_source
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. It may be beneficial to add some error handling to ensure that the ZFS source URL is valid and available. This would greatly enhance the stability of the function.

2. The use of `curl` and `wget` to download files could potentially introduce security risks if the source URLs are compromised. Implement SSL/TLS certificate checks to secure downloads.

3. In the `remote_log` calls, sensitive information such as URLs might be logged. Best practices should be put in place to sanitise any sensitive information before logging.

4. The script does something if it can't `curl` the ZFS source file (it tries `wget`), but it doesn't check if it can resolve the host or even access the network in the first place. An initial network check could be implemented to enhance the resiliency of the Bash function.

5. The script doesn't verify the downloaded file's integrity. One way to do this is to compare the checksum of the downloaded file to a known good one.

6. The function uses a known temporary workspace i.e., '/tmp/zfs-build'. It should instead create a dynamic secure temporary workspace to prevent potential file conflicts and security issues.
