Function signature: c64e26c5e886b1a0aded061414c66873630e97cae41cf2c7a37f800fd6866674

### Function overview
The `build_zfs_source()` function is a part of a shell script that fetches ZFS (Z File System) source packages, builds them, and installs them in a predefined build directory on a machine that is provisioned via a remote gateway. This function is specific to systems running Rocky Linux. ZFS is a combined file system and logical volume manager that is scalable and includes extensive protection against data corruption.

### Technical description
- **Name**: `build_zfs_source()`
- **Description**: This function fetches source packages for ZFS from a specified source URL through a remote gateway, builds them, and installs them in a build directory. It first establishes a connection with the remote gateway and fetches the index file of the source packages. After verifying the index file, it fetches the specific source package for ZFS, downloads it, and begins the process of setting up the build environment by installing the necessary build dependencies. It then extracts the source archive and initiates the build process. Finally, it checks for successful installation by querying the installed ZFS module information.
- **Globals**: None directly within function
- **Arguments**: None
- **Outputs**: Various log messages about the progress and/or success or failure of each step. The function logs this output using the `remote_log` command.
- **Returns**: `0` if the function successfully downloads, builds, and installs the ZFS packages, otherwise `1`.
- **Example usage**: `build_zfs_source`

### Quality and security recommendations
1. **Error handling**: Improve error handling by providing more specific messages about what went wrong when a step fails, and by thoroughly cleaning up (e.g., deleting temporary files and directories) when an error occurs.
2. **Dependency checks**: Before proceeding with the download, build, and installation steps, explicitly check for the presence of required tools like `curl`, `wget`, `dnf`, `tar`, etc., and give an appropriate error message if any is missing.
3. **Gatekeeping**: Check the integrity of downloaded files before proceeding to use them. This can help prevent potential security issues.
4. **Code comments**: Although the code's structure and logic are generally clear, adding more comments to explain what each significant step does would make it easier for others to understand and maintain the code.
5. **Quoting**: Always quote your variable expansions. For example, use `"$var"` instead of `$var` to prevent word splitting and pathname expansion. Already properly implemented in this code.
