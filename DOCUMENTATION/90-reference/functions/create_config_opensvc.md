Function signature: 1e0006940e609bdc531da8856a0e4150fe29d39bfd65037dae44fc9ba0ec892f

### Function Overview
The function `create_config_opensvc()` generates configuration for Open Service Controller (OpenSVC) and ensures it has single cluster agent key policy. This involves creating specific directory paths for configuration, logs, and variable data. Temporary files are created and written to before being atomically moved to their permanent locations to ensure file creation does not fail halfway through. The agent key is checked against any existing keys and overwritten under specific circumstances, providing error handling if disk key and cluster key do not match.

### Technical Description
#### Name
`create_config_opensvc()`

#### Description
A function to generate configuration files for OpenSVC and apply a single cluster agent key policy.

#### Globals
- conf_dir: The path to the configuration directory.
- log_dir: The path to the log directory.
- var_dir: The path to the variable data directory.
- conf_file: The location of the configuration file.
- key_file: The location of the agent key file.

#### Arguments
- $1 (ips_role): Role of the IP Service for OpenSVC configuration.

#### Outputs
- Write configuration, create directories and files, log error/success messages.

#### Returns
- 1: If mktemp fails or generate_opensvc_conf() fails.
- 2: If disk_key and cluster_key do not match.

#### Example Usage
```bash 
create_config_opensvc "database"
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. Add more comments and documentation within the function for better maintainability.
2. Implement more robust error checking mechanisms throughout the function to handle any potential failures. For example, check the success of mkdir, mv, chmod, chown commands.
3. Consider variable sanitization for the safety of the script. Always ensure paths and file names are secure before using them.
4. Avoid suppressing errors (2>/dev/null) to quickly identify and fix issues.
5. Enforce the use of secure file permissions and ownership, especially for key files that store sensitive data. Use least privilege principle.
6. Use cryptographic functions from trusted libraries instead of implementing them in house. This function uses `openssl rand` and in its absence, a fallback method for generating a key which would be less secure. Make openssl a requirement instead.
