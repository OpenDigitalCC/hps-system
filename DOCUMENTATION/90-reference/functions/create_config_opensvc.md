### Function overview

This function, `create_config_opensvc`, is used for creating a configuration for the OpenSVC cluster agent. It ensures that directories and files required by the OpenSVC agent exist and fall back to default values if not supplied. Configuration file backups and versioning are established to ensure the continued operation of the agent. This function enforces a single cluster agent key policy and adopts or generates a new key as required, ensuring the OpenSVC cluster agent's operational security.

### Quality and security recommendations
1. Add comments for global variables to clarify their usage.
2. The `openssl` fallback mechanism can be made more robust by ensuring the availability of `/dev/urandom`.
3. To guarantee robust and secure handling, check for the existence of required external commands early in the function.
4. Make the function more idempotent, such as checking before creating directories, to avoid unnecessary operations.
5. Document and standardize on return values to be used for better error handling.
6. Enhance logging to include more information about the success or failure of internal commands, aiding debugging.
7. Consider adding trap commands to handle unexpected termination of the function, ensuring clean-up operations are completed.
8. Add validation for arguments and script environment to ensure they are valid and safe to use.
