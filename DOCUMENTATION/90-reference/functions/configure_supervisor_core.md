### Function overview

The `configure_supervisor_core` function is designed to create and configure a supervisor core that commands process management. In this function, the initial step taken is to ascertain if the base directories for log storage exist. If not, it creates them. It then proceeds to generate a configuration file `supervisord.conf` for Supervisord in the `${HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR}` directory. This generated configuration file contains several blocks containing configurations and parameters for different components of Supervisord including the unix_http_server, supervisorctl, rpcinterface, and supervisord itself. 

### Technical description

- **name**: `configure_supervisor_core`

- **arguments**: [None]
- **outputs**: A Supervisord configuration file `supervisord.conf`.
- **returns**: No explicit return value.
- **example usage**: `configure_supervisor_core`

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Check for the existence of `${HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR}` and `${HPS_LOG_DIR}` at the beginning of the function. If, for some reason, these global variables have not been initialized or they do not exist, it might cause the function to fail.
2. Add error handling mechanisms to handle any error that may occur during the execution of `mkdir` and `cat` commands. Catching and handling these errors can prevent the function from failing unexpectedly.
3. The user credentials (username and password) should not be stored in plain text for security reasons. A secure alternative, such as using hash values, should be used.
4. Restricting the permissions (chmod) to 0700 provides a sense of security, but consider configuring the utility to run as a non-root user to secure the system more.
5. Improvements could be made by validating the configuration in `${SUPERVISORD_CONF}` before it is applied to avoid any malfunctioning of supervisord.
