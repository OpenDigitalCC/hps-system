Function signature: 9cbdb13ea8edf79033b1a96edf52ebe54e082910b6a8a403b6b2fd86a4d5b486

### Function Overview

The function `host_initialise_config()` is an initial set up tool designed to generate and assign a configuration file for a host, identified by its thus passed MAC address. It ensures that the host configuration directory exists. Then, it sets the state of the host config file to "UNCONFIGURED". Additionally, it logs the initialization of the host configuration.

### Technical Description

- **Name**: host_initialise_config
- **Description**: This function initialises host configuration file within HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR. It takes in the MAC address of the host, creates a configuration file uniquely associated with the host, sets the initial state to "UNCONFUGURED", and logs the initialization.
- **Globals**: [{ HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR: The directory to store host configuration files }]
- **Arguments**: [{ $1: MAC address of the host }]
- **Outputs**: Logs the initialization process with the file name
- **Returns**: N/A
- **Example Usage**:

    ```bash
    host_initialise_config "00:0a:95:9d:68:10"
    ```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. The function should include error handling for potential failures while creating directories or setting the state.
2. Consider integrating data validation procedures to ensure that the MAC address provided as an input matches the anticipated format.
3. Remnants of deprecated operations should be removed from the function to prevent future confusion or unintentional uncommenting.
4. To prevent unexpected errors or unauthorized manipulation, it is suggested to place appropriate file and directory permissions on the created configuration file and directory.
5. It would be more secure to generate unique names for configuration files rather than using the MAC address, which can be predictable or easily available. This would make them less susceptible to targeted attacks.
