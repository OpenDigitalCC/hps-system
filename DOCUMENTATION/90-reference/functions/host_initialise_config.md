Function signature: 9cbdb13ea8edf79033b1a96edf52ebe54e082910b6a8a403b6b2fd86a4d5b486

##### Function Overview

The `host_initialise_config` function is designed to initialise a configuration file for a host using the MAC address. The function first ensures that a directory for host configurations exists, and then sets the state of the host configuration to "UNCONFIGURED". Afterwards, the function logs the initialisation of the host configuration.

##### Technical Description

Here is the technical description for `host_initialise_config`:

- **name**: `host_initialise_config`
- **description**: Initialises a configuration file for a host using the MAC address. The state of the host configuration is set to "UNCONFIGURED", and the initialisation is logged. The function should be invoked with the MAC address as an argument.
- **globals:**
  - HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR: The directory in which the host configuration files are stored
- **arguments:** 
  - $1: MAC address of the host for which the configuration file must be initialised
- **outputs**: Logs the initialisation of the host configuration file
- **returns**: None
- **example usage**: `host_initialise_config "00:0a:95:9d:68:16"`

##### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Make sure to use a valid MAC address as the argument when calling `host_initialise_config`.
2. Verify that the `${HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR}` directory exists or the script has the necessary permissions to create it. This is to avoid failures in `mkdir`.
3. Commented out parts of the code (i.e., lines for adding timestamps and echoing the configuration file) should be removed or uncommented if they are needed. Leaving large parts of code commented out can lead to confusion.
4. Validate the input to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
5. Handle potential errors in the function, like issues while creating directories, setting states, or logging information.
