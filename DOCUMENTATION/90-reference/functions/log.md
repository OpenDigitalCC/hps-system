### Function Overview 

The `log` function is designed to output and forward log messages. It prepends the string "HPS" and current time in the "Hour:Minute:Second" format to the log message, then writes the complete string to the standard output. The function also sends the log message to a remote log function called `remote_log`.

### Technical Description 

- **Name:** `log`
- **Description:** This function takes any number of arguments, appends them after a prepended string which contains "HPS" and the current time. The final string is then echoed (printed to stdout). It also sends every log message to `remote_log` which is assumed to be another logging function.
- **Globals:** No global variables are used or modified by this function.
- **Arguments:** Any set of strings which need to be logged. Example: `$*: log message`.
- **Outputs:** Outputs to STDOUT. Example: `[HPS:14:20:35] your log message`.
- **Returns:** It does not return any value but calls another function called `remote_log`.
- **Example usage:** 

```bash
log "Application started."
```
This will print: 

```bash
[HPS:14:20:35] Application started.
```
and will also send "Application started." as a log message to the remote log.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. **Secure transfer for remote logging:** The function `remote_log` which is called within this function should ensure secure transmission of log messages, especially if these logs are being sent over a network.
2. **Error Handling:** The `remote_log` function is called without any error handling. If it fails for any reason, there won't be any fallback or even notification given to the user. This needs to be ensured for better quality.
3. **Detailed TimeStamp:** The timestamp is currently pretty simple just HH:MM:SS. For better track of logs, it could be enriched to contain more details like the date, timezone, milliseconds etc.
4. **Input Validation:** This function accepts any string without validation. Although this is generally okay for a logging function, it could be an issue if certain types of strings could cause problems with the `remote_log` function. Consider validating inputs or sanitizing them if necessary.
