##### Function Overview

The `urlencode` function is a Bash function designed to encode a string in the x-www-form-urlencoded representation. This is used when encoding a string to be included in a URL. The function iterates over each character in the provided string. If the character is an alphanumeric or a small set of special characters, it's added to the output as is. Any other character is converted to its hexadecimal ASCII representation and prepended with a '%', in line with the specifications for URL encoding.

##### Quality and Security recommendations

1. Make sure to properly escape any characters when running this function to avoid command injection attacks.
2. Avoid using utf-8 characters as bash printf might not handle them well, leading to incorrect results.
3. Consider wrapping the functionality in a script with error handling to avoid potential issues with special characters in the input string.
4. Be wary of null bytes in the input as bash string operations are undefined in these scenarios.
