### Function overview

The `_osvc_kv_set` function is a basic utility for updating configurations in an environment. This function accepts two parameters, a key and a value, and it uses these parameters to modify or add new key-value entries in the configuration settings. It does this with the help of the 'om config set' command.


### Technical description
```Pandoc
- name: _osvc_kv_set
- description: The function `_osvc_kv_set` is used for setting a key-value pair in the configuration system. It takes two arguments: a key and a value, which it then forwards to the 'om config set' command together as a key-value pair.
- globals: [ om config: A command-line utility for the configuration management ]
- arguments: [ $1: The key of the configuration setting to be updated, $2: The new value to be set for the referred key]
- outputs: The `om config set` line of the new configuration setting with the updated value.
- returns: Returns nothing.
- example usage: `_osvc_kv_set "config_key" "new_value"`
```

### Quality and security recommendations
1. Validate inputs: The function does not perform any input validation for the function parameters. It is recommended to add input validators to ensure the key and value arguments meet specific requirements (e.g. non-empty, of certain length, or matches a specific pattern).
2. Error logging: Error handling and logging can be improved. Currently, an error resulting from the 'om config set' command will be invisible to the user.
3. Security: Since configuration settings can often contain sensitive information, ensure that handling of such data complies with best security practices and standards.
