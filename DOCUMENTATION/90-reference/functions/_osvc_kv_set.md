### Quality and security recommendations

1. Always validate input before processing: The function currently does not perform any validation or sanitization of the arguments it receives before processing them, making it open to potential misuse or errors. Consider implementing input validation to ensure that correct and safe values are being passed in as arguments.
2. Handle errors gracefully: While the function does use the `${var:?word}` expression to handle missing arguments, its error handling could be more explicit. For example, it could log a custom error message or use an `exit` call to halt the entire script.
3. Write test cases: To fully ensure the function's reliability and maintainability, consider writing unit tests that inspect the behavior of the function in various contexts and with different inputs.
