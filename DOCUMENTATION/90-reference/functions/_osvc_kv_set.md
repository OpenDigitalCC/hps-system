### Function Overview

The function `_osvc_kv_set()` is a simple key-value setting function in Bash. The purpose of this function is to set a certain key-value pair in the `om` configuration. It accepts two arguments: a key and a value and then it passes these arguments as a set operation to the `om` configuration.

### Technical Description

- **Function name:** `_osvc_kv_set()`
- **Description:** This Bash Script function sets a given key-value pair in the `om` configuration.
- **Globals:** None
- **Arguments:** 
  - `$1: k` - Represents the key to set in the `om` configuration. This is a mandatory argument and the function will return an error if it is not provided.
  - `$2: v` - Represents the value to set for the given key in the `om` configuration. This is a mandatory argument and the function will return an error if it is not provided.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Ensure that proper error handling is put in place. Right now, if arguments are not provided, the function will fail. It would better if the function did not execute until necessary arguments were provided.
2. Consider adding additional checks for the validity of the key and value. This would prevent any invalid configurations from being made.
3. Check for possible code injections in the key and value arguments.
4. Make sure the `om` configuration API is secured and only accessible by authorized users or scripts.
5. The function modifies global configuration directly. It would be more secure if these changes were reviewed or logged for auditing purposes.
6. Documentation is very crucial for maintenance and further enhancement so make sure all the function details and changes are well documented.
