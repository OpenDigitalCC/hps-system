### Function Overview

The Bash function, `configure_kickstart()`, is used to automate the generation of a Kickstart configuration file for a new Linux cluster. This function requires a cluster name as the argument, which is then used to name and generate a Kickstart file in the designated path. This function includes a configuration set up that ensures system requirements, including network configuration, root password, partitioning, and package selection, among others, are met. An error message is displayed when a cluster name is not provided as the argument.

### Technical Description

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Make sure the Kickstart file path is a secure location and has the right permission settings to avoid unauthorized access or alterations.
2. Ensure proper validation is performed on the input cluster name to avoid possible command injection vulnerabilities.
3. The root and user passwords are currently set with placeholder values. Change these values to secure ones before using on production systems.
4. Ensure you handle the potential issue where the cluster name given might already exist, overwriting an existing kickstart file.
5. Consider including a verification step to confirm the successful generation of the Kickstart file or to catch any possible errors during the file creation process.
6. It's recommended to ensure the installation log (`/root/ks-post.log`) is properly secured or even disabled in a production environment to protect system information.
