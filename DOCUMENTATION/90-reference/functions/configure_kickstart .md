##### Function Overview

The `configure_kickstart` function is used to generate a Kickstart file that can be utilized for automated installations of the CentOS operating system on Linux clusters. The function creates a Kickstart file with a predefined configuration, where cluster name is passed as an argument. If the required argument is not provided, the function outputs an error message and exits. Once the Kickstart file is generated, the function confirms its creation by outputting its location.

##### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. It is a good practice to conduct variable and input validation for better quality code execution.
2. Avoid using plaintext passwords in scripts or configuration files as seen in this Kickstart file. It's better to use hashed passwords or some form of secure password management.
3. The initial root password is locked, it would be good to establish a process for initial login or provide mechanisms for first-time initialization of root password.
4. Logs for the post-install scripts should be redirected to a secure location where access is strictly controlled to prevent unauthorized access.
5. Further secure the script by providing restrictive file permissions. The generated Kickstart file may contain sensitive information, hence permissions should be carefully managed.
