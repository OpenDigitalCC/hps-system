### Function overview

The `url_decode()` function is a bash function which decodes a URL-encoded string. The function is part of a logging system that decodes a received message before sending it to the system's log and writing it to a file, if possible. The `url_decode()` function replaces "+" characters in the encoded string with spaces, and then replaces any remaining percent-encoded characters with the corresponding ASCII characters.

### Technical description

- **Name:** url_decode
- **Description:** This function takes in a URL-encoded string and decodes it into a usable string format. The decoded message is then passed on to the system's log and written to a file, if possible.
- **Globals:** 
   - `VAR: desc`: No global variables are explicitly used within this function.
- **Arguments:** 
   - `$1: desc`: This is the URL-encoded string to be decoded.
- **Outputs:** Outputs decoded version of the URL-encoded input string.
- **Returns:** Does not return any explicit value.
- **Example usage:** 

```bash
  # Declare a URL-encoded string
  url_encoded="Hello%20World%21%0A"
  
  # Decode the message
  url_decoded=$(url_decode "$url_encoded")
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Robustness: Check if the URL-encoded string passed to the function is correctly formatted. This can help prevent unexpected behaviour or errors during the decoding process.
2. Error Handling: Improve error handling by implementing a mechanism to inform the user when the writing to the log file fails.
3. Redundancy: The function currently prints error messages to the console in addition to logging them to the system's log. Consider removing this duplication to make the function more efficient.
4. Security: Avoid logging sensitive information. If the function is used in a situation where the messages to be logged include sensitive data, ensure this data is either not logged or is properly obfuscated before logging.
