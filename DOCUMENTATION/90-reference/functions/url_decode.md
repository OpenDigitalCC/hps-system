##### Function overview

The function `url_decode()` is designed to replace URL-encoded values with their original character representation. It first swaps the '+' signs with spaces, then replaces each '%xx' (where 'xx' are hexadecimal values) with their corresponding characters. This function is then used to decode a message and log it, using the logger utility. If possible, the function also writes the decoded message with associated metadata to a specified log file.

##### Technical description

- **Name:** url_decode
- **Description:** This function replaces URL-encoded values in a string with their original character representation. It also handles logging the decoded message via the logger utility and to a specified log file if possible. If the log file cannot be written to, it logs an error message.
- **Globals:** None.
- **Arguments:**
  - $1: This is the URL-encoded data to be decoded.
- **Outputs:** The function outputs the decoded message to stdout.
- **Returns:** This function doesn't explicitly return a value.
- **Example usage:**

   ```bash
   local raw_msg="%68%65%6C%6C%6F%2B%77%6F%72%6C%64"
   local msg
   msg="$(url_decode "$raw_msg")"
   echo $msg  # output: "hello world"
   ```

##### Quality and security recommendations

1. Always validate the inputs before operating on them. In this case, it would be wise to ensure the URL-encoded string only contains valid characters.
2. If possible, try to avoid using global variables as they may lead to unexpected behavior due to their scope. In this case, there are no global variables used which is a good practice.
3. Make sure to handle error scenarios gracefully. In this function, there's already handling when it cannot write to a log file though more checks could be added for other possible fails.
4. Ensure that the permissions of the log file are set accordingly so that only those authorized can read or write to it. This could help prevent unauthorized access to potentially sensitive information being logged.
5. Consider enhancing the function to disable logging or to log to a different location based on a config or environment variable. This enables more flexibility without changing the code.
