### 1. Function overview

The `zpool_create_on_free_disk` function is a Bash utility for working with data storage in a Unix-like operating system. It initializes a zpool on free disk space using a specified strategy. It has preset values for variables such as `strategy` (defaults to "first"), `mpoint` (defaults to "/srv/storage"), `force`, `dry_run`, and `apply_default` all of which can be adjusted according to user requirements.

### 2. Technical description

- **Name**: zpool_create_on_free_disk
- **Description**: A bash function designed to initialize a zpool on available disk space. This function allows users to set their preference with a number of preset options to customize the setup according to their needs. The possible options include specifying a storage strategy, the mount point for the storage, and whether to force the operation, do a dry run or apply default settings.
- **Globals**: 
    - `strategy`: Defines the strategy for initializing the zpool storage. Default is "first".
    - `mpoint`: The directory in which the initialized storage will be mounted. Default is "/srv/storage".
    - `force`: Defines whether or not to force the initialization. Default is 0 (do not force).
    - `dry_run`: Defines whether or not to perform a dry run. Default is 0 (do not dry run).
    - `apply_defaults`: Defines whether to apply the default settings. Default is 1 (apply defaults).
- **Arguments**: 
    - `$1`: The first positional parameter is not explicitly used in this function.
    - `$2`: The second positional parameter is not explicitly used in this function.

```

### 3. Quality and security recommendations

1. Validate input: Although this function does not take arguments, it is always good practice to ensure any input or sources from which input is derived are valid.
2. Error handling: Include error handling mechanisms for situations where the disk space is not available or the formatted storage cannot be mounted at the specified mount point.
3. Security: Ensure that the storage's mount point has appropriate permissions set, and sensitive data is securely managed.
4. Code clarity: Some variables are initialized but not used, these could be removed for improved code clarity.
5. Logging: Add comprehensive logging for tracking the sequence of operations. Logs would aid in debugging and resolving any issues that might arise.
6. Code Comments: Adding comments to explain the purpose of complex code blocks would make the function more maintainable.
