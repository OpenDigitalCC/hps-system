### Function overview
The `bootstrap_get_functions` function is designed to initialize local variables `gateway` and `distro` by invoking respective utility functions. The URL, created using these variables, is intended to reach a specific script on the server. The function uses `curl` to fetch the desired script and runs it within the script's current shell context. If script loading fails, an error message is printed, distinguishing between the error cases.

### Technical description
- Name: 
  - `bootstrap_get_functions`

- Description:

- Globals: 
  - No globals are used directly by this function.

- Arguments: 
  - The function does not take any arguments.

- Outputs: 
  - Success message indicating the sourced script URL, or

- Returns: 
  - 2 if the sourcing fails.

- Example usage:

  bootstrap_get_functions
  ```

### Quality and security recommendations
1. Consider outputting different messages or detailed exit codes to vividly distinguish between "Failed to fetch" and "Failed to source".
2. Ensure that the `gateway` and `distro` returned by their respective functions are sanitized and do not contain any potentially harmful or unexpected characters.
3. Validate the existence and functional state of the specified gateway and the `boot_manager.sh` script before proceeding to fetch and source to avoid remote execution failures.
4. Use secure HTTP (HTTPS) for the URL to maintain secure communication while fetching the script.
5. Consider adding error handling and recovery logic for network interruptions.
