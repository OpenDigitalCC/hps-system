Function signature: c440af9a86acddde30570b73ae6d52c7bddf38d765f513ea26ebf15ee4805200

##### Function Overview
The function `initialise_distro_string` uses local variables and information taken directly from the operating system to populate a string in a specific format. This string includes the architecture of the machine, the manufacturer, the name of the operating system and its version. 

##### Technical Description
**Name:**  
`initialise_distro_string`

**Description:**  
This Bash function is used to identify specific details about the host machine's operating system, including architecture (via `uname -m`), manufacturer (defaulted to 'linux') and, if available, the operating system's name and version (via `/etc/os-release`). If the OS name and version cannot be determined, they are set to 'unknown'. The function returns a string comprising these elements, formatted as: `cpu-mfr-osname-osver`.

**Globals:**  
No global variables used.

**Arguments:**  
No arguments are required.

**Outputs:**  
Produces a string formatted as follows: `cpu-mfr-osname-osver`

**Returns:**  
The final string combining the cpu, manufacturer, OS name and version.

**Example Usage:**  
```Bash
distro_string=$(initialise_distro_string)
echo $distro_string
```

##### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. It is advised to add validation of the inputs before using them. 
2. Handle the case when the `/etc/os-release` file does not exist or is inaccessible. Right now, the function defaults to 'unknown' in such a case, but perhaps a warning message, error code or a fallback mechanism could be implemented.
3. A division of the function into smaller, more specific functions could be considered to enhance readability and maintainability.
4. The function relies on default variables set by external systems like OS. This could be secured by sanitizing these variables before using them in case these external systems get compromised.
5. Test this function across different operating systems or variations of Linux to ensure it works reliably across all.
6. Error handling should be added to ensure the function behaves as expected even in unforeseen situations.
