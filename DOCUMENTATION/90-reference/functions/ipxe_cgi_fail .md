### Function overview

The function `ipxe_cgi_fail()` is utilized to handle failure during the Implicit PXE (iPXE) process. This function generates an iPXE header, sends an error message to the hp's log, reports the error in the iPXE code to be interpreted by iPXE supporting software, waits for 10 seconds, then reboots the system.

### Technical description

- **Name**: ipxe_cgi_fail
- **Description**: This function is intended to handle failures during the iPXE process. Upon invocation, it creates an iPXE header, logs an error message, alerts the user about the failure, waits a bit, then reboots the system.
- **Globals**: None.
- **Arguments**: 
  - `$1: cfmsg`: This is the error message to be logged and displayed.
- **Outputs**: An iPXE formatted error message, including the input error message.
- **Returns**: Nothing. The function does not have a return statement, but it does call exit, terminating the script it's within.
- **Example usage**: `ipxe_cgi_fail "Network boot failed"`

### Quality and security recommendations

1. **Input Validation**: Implement input validation on `$1` to check if it is set and isn't an empty string before proceeding with the rest of the function. This would make the function more robust against erroneous invocations.
2. **Error handling on `exit`**: The script terminates abruptly with `exit`. It's recommended instead to return an error code, and let the main section of your script decide how to handle the error.
3. **Message Standardization**: It's suggested to use standardized error codes and messages to make troubleshooting more efficient.
4. **User Instructions**: Since the error causes the system to reboot, provide more information to the user regarding what they should do after the reboot.
5. **Securing Logging**: Ensure only authorized and authenticated applications or services can write to the log file. This prevents unauthorized modifications which could lead to misinterpretation of system states.
