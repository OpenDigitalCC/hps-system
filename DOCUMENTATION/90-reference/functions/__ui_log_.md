### Function Overview
The `__ui_log` function is a Bash function designed for logging and debugging purposes. The function is prefixed by two underscores, a convention sometimes used to indicate a function is 'private' or expected not to be used directly by users or other scripts. This function is responsible for echoing the provided arguments `"$*"` to the standard error (`>&2`), prefixed with the string `"[UI]"`. It provides a clean and easy way to standardize the logging output format and centralize the logging functionality. 

### Technical Description
- **Name:** `__ui_log`
- **Description:** This function echoes its input arguments to the standard error, with a `[UI]` prefix, which could indicate that this log is related to user interface operations. 
- **Globals:** None.
- **Arguments:** 
  - `$*`: All positional parameters joined together. These are the messages to be logged by this function.
- **Outputs:** The output is a string formatted as `[UI] your input` where `your input` is the value of the provided arguments. Note, output is always to standadard error.
- **Returns:** Does not return a value, only produces output to standard error.
- **Example Usage:**

```bash
__ui_log 'This is a test log.'
# Output: "[UI] This is a test log."
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. The current function uses the `$*` variable to capture all input arguments. However, it's generally safe to use `$@` in quotes (`"$@"`) instead of `$*` to prevent argument splitting or word splitting.
2. The function echoes the messages to `stderr`, which is a great practice to distinguish between error messages and regular output. However, consider providing a provision for users to redirect the error messages to a file to keep the console clean and review the logs later.
3. Since this function is used for logging, it may be beneficial to add a timestamp to the logged messages for better traceability of the events.
4. Although the function's name starts with two underscores, indicating it may be a 'private' function, Bash does not have true private functions. Therefore, clearly document the intended use of this function.
5. If this function is going to deal with sensitive information, make sure to sanitize or mask the data before logging it to prevent leaking sensitive information.
