### Function Overview

The function `cgi_fail` depicted above performs the essential role of logging an error message and outputting it through the server's CGI header. It takes the error message as an argument and performs two main actions: logging the error message using `hps_log` function and outputting the error message. This function can come handy in cases where you want to keep track of all the errors that occur on your server, and also display them on the server for debugging purposes.

### Technical Description

In a more detailed technical perspective, the function's definition is structured as follows:

- **Name:** `cgi_fail`

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. **Input Validation:** Given that the function is accepting user-provided strings, the function should perform proper input validation on the error message to prevent possible injection attacks.
2. **Error Handling:** The function does not contain any explicit error handling. Implementing checkpoints to verify successful suppression of errors might be useful.
3. **Logging:** Consider adding timestamps and additional context to the logged errors for ease of troubleshooting.
4. **Fallbacks:** It may be beneficial to add a fallback or default error message if a blank error message is provided.
5. **Code Documentation:** Make sure to document what the function does and how to use it. Include details of what each argument should be and what the function returns. This can help others to use the function correctly and avoid mistakes.
