### Function overview

This bash function, `validate_hostname`, undertakes the task of validating a hostname according to specified conditions and rules. It initially checks whether the given hostname is empty or beyond maximum allowable characters (253 in this case). Post this, the function splits the hostname into individual labels based on dots in the hostname. For each label, the function checks if the length is exceeding the permissible limit of 63 characters or if the length is zero, and whether the label is properly formatted, allowing alphanumeric characters and hyphens but not starting or ending with a hyphen.

2. Use principles of least privilege for any direct access to system level resources, such as files or data structures.
3. Keep an eye on performance and compliances with large input values.
4. Implement unit tests to ensure the functionality of this function is as expected.
5. Include a logging mechanism to audit the program's activity which helps in troubleshooting security issues.
