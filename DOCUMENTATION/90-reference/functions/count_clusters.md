Function signature: f85fd6ef48db5cb9daae832a23896a3098e1015c070794f3fe360262d2c24879

### Function Overview

The `count_clusters` function is designed to count and echo the number of clusters found in a specified directory (`HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR`). The function will give a warning and return `0` if no clusters are found or if the directory does not exist.

### Technical Description

- Name: `count_clusters`
- Description: This function counts the number of clusters in a specific directory (`HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR`). It provides messages for situations where no clusters are found or the directory does not exist and in such cases, it returns `0`.
- Globals: [`HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR`: directory to count cluster files from]
- Arguments: No arguments
- Outputs: Writes the number of directories (which correspond to cluster files) within the base directory to the standard output. Echoes warnings to the standard error output for circumstances where no clusters are found or the base directory is not found.
- Returns: Always returns `0`
- Example usage: 
```bash
source ./count_clusters.sh
echo $(count_clusters)
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Always use double quotes around variable references to prevent word splitting and pathname expansion.
2. Use `return` or `exit` instead of `echo` to make error messages more visible and understandable.
3. Validate all input, particularly those from an external or untrusted source.
4. Use a more specific file search pattern to only find correct cluster files ( e.g. use `*.conf` to only count configuration files).
5. Avoid hard-coding values such as directory names in your scripts. This will make the script more flexible and reusable. Instead, use parameters or configuration files to customize these values.
6. Consider adding error handling in the function to manage potential problems that may arise during its execution. For example, provide a meaningful error message if the directory does not exist or is not readable.
7. Document the function, its inputs, outputs, and any assumptions it makes about its operating environment. This will make it easier for others to use and maintain.
