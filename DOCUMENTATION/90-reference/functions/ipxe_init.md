### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Error Handling: Uncomment and adapt the code section dealing with the absence of a host configuration. It is essential that your system handles errors or exceptions properly to resist crashes or inaccuracies.
     
2. Input Validation: While the current function does not have any direct user input, if modifications are made in the future to incorporate any, rigorous input validation should be conducted to reduce potential security risks.

3. Code Comments: There are good code comments in the functions, which increases the readability and maintainability of your code. However, ensure that any changes or updates to the code are reflected in the comments as well.

4. Secure Fetch: When fetching files or configurations over a network, ensure that secure protocols are used to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

5. Testing: Conduct rigorous testing to ensure the function operates as expected under a variety of conditions.
