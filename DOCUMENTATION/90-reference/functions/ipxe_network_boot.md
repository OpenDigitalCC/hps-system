Function signature: 12978609d623d739eeb7768560e3b7ba0c3cd5d711ae46c9949271f4abc20919

### Function Overview

The function `ipxe_network_boot()` is primarily designed to determine the type of host system and perform a network boot accordingly. The function fetches the host type and logs it for debugging purposes, before proceeding to inspect the host type and perform operations correspondingly. If the host type is 'TCH', it validates the Alpine repository before attempting to boot. If the validation fails, it logs an error message, sends a failure message, and returns 1, demonstrating unsuccessful execution. If validation is successful, a boot operation specific to 'TCH' systems is performed. For any other type of host, the method logs a message notifying that network boot is not supported for that host type.

### Technical Description

- **Function Name**: `ipxe_network_boot`
- **Description**: Responsible for determining the host type and carrying out a network boot operation accordingly.
- **Globals**: `mac`: the mac address of the host system.
- **Arguments**: None
- **Outputs**: Logs messages for debugging, errors, and host type support. May execute a failure response if the Alpine repository is not prepared.
- **Returns**: `1` if the Alpine repository validation fails, otherwise no explicit return.
- **Example Usage**:
  ```
  ipxe_network_boot
  ```
Note: This function could only be invoked without any parameters.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Consider including an input validation to check if a `mac` global is defined before performing any other operations.
2. Additional error handling could be implemented to account for any potential pitfalls or unexpected issues during the booting process.
3. Providing additional support for other host types beyond 'TCH' could enhance flexibility and universality of the function.
4. Regularly review and update the function to ensure compatibility with updated versions of the Alpine repository and host configurations.
5. Uphold good practice of ensuring the sensitive information, such as MAC addresses, used within the logs and outputs is secured appropriately.
