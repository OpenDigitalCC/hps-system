### Function overview

The `storage_deprovision_volume` function is primarily used to deprovision a given volume in storage. It first parses the arguments for IQN and volume name, then ensures that the host type is suitable for deprovisioning. Additionally, it verifies the existence of a local zpool name. The function subsequently deletes the iSCSI target and the volume based on the provided IQN and volume name. Failure in deletion results in an error log, and successful deprovisioning returns 0.

### Technical description

- **Name**: `storage_deprovision_volume`
- **Description**: Parses arguments and deprovisions a specified storage volume by deleting the iSCSI target and the volume itself. Checks for host type and presence of a local zpool name.
- **Globals**: None.
- **Arguments**: 
  - `$1`: Action flag. Possible flags are `--iqn` (sets internal iqn variable) and `--zvol-name` (sets internal zvol_name variable)
  - `$2`: Corresponding value for the flag set by $1 (either iqn value or zvol name depending on $1).
- **Outputs**: Logs into a remote system information about the steps made by the function. If errors occur, they are reported in the log.
- **Returns**: 
  - `1` if invalid flag is set, required flags are not set, host type is not 'SCH', zpool name could not be determined or deletion of zvol fails.
  - `0` if the volume was successfully deprovisioned.
- **Example usage**:

```bash
storage_deprovision_volume --iqn iqn.2003-01.org.linux-iscsi.localhost:x8664.sn.d33fadd1d40 --zvol-name zvol1
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Make sure only authorized users can run this function to ensure that volumes are not accidentally deprovisioned.
2. Enhance error checking to catch unknown flags and handle them appropriately.
3. Consider adding functionality to backup the volume before deletion to allow recovery in case of accidental deprovisioning.
4. Always use secure credentials when logging into the remote system to protect the integrity of the data.
5. Consider hardening the script by restricting the ability to deprovision based on additional factors, such as the time of day or the load on the system.
6. Regularly review and audit the logs produced by the function for any irregular activities.
