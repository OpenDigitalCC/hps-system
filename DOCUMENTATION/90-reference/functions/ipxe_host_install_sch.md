### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. To enhance security, ensure that input from the user is properly sanitized before it is fed into the `imgfetch` and `chain` commands to avoid potential command injection attacks.
2. Since this function relies on external scripts hosted at `CGI_URL`, make sure that this URL is secure and the scripts are reviewed for potential vulnerabilities.
3. The function currently does not handle errors gracefully. Adding some error handling logic would likely improve the function, for example by informing the user if fetching or chaining the CGI scripts fail.
4. Avoid storing any sensitive information such as keys or passwords in global variables. Use secure methods for authentication.
