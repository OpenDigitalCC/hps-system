### Function Overview

The function `handle_menu_item()` is designed to handle a wide variety of menu items within the iPXE interface. The function takes two parameters - an item, which is the menu item to be handled, and a mac, which is the MAC address of the host for whom the menu item is being processed. The function uses a case statement to handle a variety of possible menu items, and will log an error and fail if an unknown menu item is entered.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. The function should have a more standardized output mechanism, rather than simply echoing to the console in some cases.
2. It would be beneficial to add further error checking to ensure that the `item` and `mac` parameters are properly formed and valid before the function attempts to process them.
3. Certain case options may produce unintended side effects - for example, `unconfigure` and `reboot` both trigger an `ipxe_reboot` which could potentially interrupt ongoing processes. Further consideration should be given to these potential issues.
4. Security could be improved by ensuring that only permitted users are allowed to call the `handle_menu_item()` function, or by adding additional security checks within the function to prevent unauthorized users from executing certain menu options.
