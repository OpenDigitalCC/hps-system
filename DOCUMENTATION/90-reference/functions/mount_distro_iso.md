##### Quality and security recommendations

1. Parameter Validation: Consider enhancing the function by adding more validation to the parameters. Right now, missing or incorrect arguments could lead to unwanted behavior.
2. Error Handling: There's no error handling if the `mount` command fails. Adding an error handler for this scenario could enhance the quality of the script and provide more information for debugging.
3. Security Review: Review the function to ensure the script handling sensitive input correctly. Keep in mind that improperly handled inputs can result in security issues.
4. Path Validation: Ensure the paths used in the script are safe and can't lead to a path traversal attack.
5. Logging: Enhance logging to include more useful information for debugging, like wrong argument values or file path-related issues.
