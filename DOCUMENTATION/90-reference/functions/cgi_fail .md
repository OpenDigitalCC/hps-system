### Quality and security recommendations

1. Validate the input: You should consider validating your function's input. This way it ensures that the error message passed is a string so that it can be correctly processed.
2. Error handling and logging: You should ensure proper error handling and logging is in place. This is vital for auditing and rectifying the faults in the system. Implement a standardized error logging method.
3. Escape special characters: In the echoed error message, make sure to escape any HTML special characters for security purpose.
4. Usage of local variables: Use local variables where possible. Usage of global variables may lead to the risk of variable pollution.
5. Use appropriate HTTP status codes: Always use appropriate HTTP status codes in conjunction with error messages to help client understand the problem better.
