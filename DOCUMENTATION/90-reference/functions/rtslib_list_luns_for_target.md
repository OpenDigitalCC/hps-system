### Function overview

The `rtslib_list_luns_for_target` is a Bash function designed to list the Logical Unit Numbers (LUNs) for a specific iSCSI target. It accepts two arguments, generates an iSCSI Qualified Name (IQN) for the target, and then uses a Python script to iterate through the LUNs. Information on each LUN is then outputted, or an error message is displayed.

### Technical description

- **Name**: `rtslib_list_luns_for_target`
- **Description**: This bash function lists the LUNs for a particular iSCSI target. It achieves this by launching an embedded Python script which uses the _rtslib_fb_ library to enumerate over the LUNs for a target.
- **Globals**: None
- **Arguments**:
    - `$1`: The remote host. Used to construct the iqn.
- **Outputs**: Depending on the results of its operations, the function either outputs each of the LUNs for the specified iSCSI target or an error message when the target is not found.
- **Returns**: Nothing
- **Example Usage**:
    ```
    rtslib_list_luns_for_target "localhost"
    ```

### Quality and security recommendations
1. Ensure that the remote host argument is appropriately sanitized to prevent potential command injection attacks.
2. Consider handling or logging the captured Python exceptions for debugging and traceability.
3. Look into dealing with situations where the Python environment or the required libraries are not available.
4. Assess whether the function behaves as expected if called with an invalid or unreachable host.
5. Consider how the function will respond if `date` cannot provide the expected output.
6. Check that the user running this script has the necessary privileges for the script's operations.
7. Enforce strict mode in the bash script to minimize potential errors due to uninitialized variables or unhandled errors.
