### Function Overview

The function `node_lio_stop` is a bash script function designed to stop a specific service, named target, running on a system. It logs its activity using another function `remote_log` and uses the `systemctl` command to stop the service. If successfully stopped, it generates a success message and returns 0. If the attempt to stop the service fails, it generates a failure message and returns 1.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** node_lio_stop
- **Description:** This function attempts to stop the 'target' service on a system. It employs the ``systemctl` command to accomplish this, but also provides logging functionality through the `remote_log` function for tracking activity.
- **Globals:** None.
- **Arguments:** None.
- **Outputs:** This function generates log messages indicating the status of the stop operation - either successful or failed.
- **Returns:** This function returns a binary response. It returns 0 if the stop operation is successful and 1 if it fails.
- **Example Usage:** 

```bash
node_lio_stop
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Consider implementing error logging or notifications, such as sending an alert email, when the service fails to stop.
2. For enhanced security, you could use the `sudo` command to enforce the function to run with root permissions only, thus restricting the usage of the function to authorized users only.
3. Include verbose commenting, particularly for areas handling failures or errors, which can help for easier troubleshooting in future.
4. Consider allowing the function to accept a parameter to specify the service to stop, instead of hardcoding 'target'. This would make it more flexible and reusable.
5. Implement a check to understand whether the 'target' service is active before attempting to stop it.
