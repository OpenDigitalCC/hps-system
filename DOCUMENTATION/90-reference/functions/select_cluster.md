### Function overview

The `select_cluster()` function is part of a shell script running in bash. The purpose is to select a directory representing a cluster from a predetermined base directory. The function processes subdirectories in this base directory as separate clusters. If no subdirectories are identified, the function returns an error. After presenting a list of available clusters, it then allows the user to select one. The selection is stripped of its trailing slash before being returned.

### Technical description

- **Name:** `select_cluster`
- **Description:** Identify subdirectories in a predefined base directory (i.e. clusters) and allows the user to select one.
- **Globals:** `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR` - The base directory where subdirectories (clusters) are located.
- **Arguments:** None.
- **Outputs:** If no clusters are found in the base directory, it echoes an error message. In the case a cluster is selected, it outputs the selected directory path without the trailing slash.
- **Returns:** If there aren't any clusters it returns 1. If a cluster is selected, the function does not explicitly return a value. However, the selected cluster (the last command result) is returned implicitly.
- **Example usage:** 
  ```
  select_cluster
  ```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Consider adding validation to check if the base directory exists and is readable.
2. It would be better to handle errors more formally, using explicit error handling techniques rather than simply printing to STDERR and returning a non-zero status.
3. The function is highly dependent on the state of `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR`, but does not check if this variable has been set. A check should be added.
4. Null selection of a single cluster isn't currently handled. Meaningful feedback should be given to the user when they do not select a cluster.
5. The list of clusters could be sorted for easier navigation and selection by the user.
