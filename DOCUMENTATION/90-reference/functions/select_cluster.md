##### Function Overview

The `select_cluster` function searches for clusters in a specified base directory, and prompts the user to select one of the available clusters. If no clusters are found in the base directory, the function prints a message to standard error and returns with an error status.

##### Technical Description

 - **Name:** `select_cluster`
 - **Description:** The function seeks for clusters within a specified base directory. If clusters are found, it will prompt the user to select one. If no clusters are found, an error message is displayed and an error status is returned.
 - **Globals:** 
    - `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR`: The base directory where the function looks for clusters.
 - **Arguments:**
    - The function does not take any arguments.
 - **Outputs:** 
    - In case of no clusters being found, the function outputs: `[!] No clusters found in $base_dir` to stderr.
    - Asks the user to select a cluster: `[?] Select a cluster:`.
 - **Returns:** 
    - If no clusters are found, it returns `1`.
    - If a cluster is selected, it echoes the selected cluster's path and returns.
 - **Example usage:**
```bash
select_cluster
```

##### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. **Error handling:** The function could benefit from more rigorous error handling. For instance, it may be desirable to check whether the base directory exists and is readable before attempting to look for clusters.
2. **Input validation:** Although this function does not take any arguments, if future modifications lead to user-provided inputs, proper validation should be incorporated to prevent command injection attacks.
3. **Logging:** Consider adding logging statements to track the execution flow and any potential errors of the function for easier debugging and auditing.
4. **Documentation:** All changes, no matter how minor, should be documented to keep the function's description up-to-date and help future developers understand its operation.
