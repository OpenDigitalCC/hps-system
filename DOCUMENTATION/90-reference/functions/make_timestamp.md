### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. This function has no user-input, hence it should be safe from security flaws that could result from unreliable user input.
2. Since the `date` command is a common Unix command, it should be available in most environments. However, in case the environment does not support the `date` command, appropriate error handling could be added.
3. For quality, consider adding checks if UTC timezone is required or if local timezone would suffice. If different timezones are needed, consider making the timezone an optional input to the function.
4. If the function will be used as part of larger scripts, consider returning the value instead of printing to allow better usage of this function.
