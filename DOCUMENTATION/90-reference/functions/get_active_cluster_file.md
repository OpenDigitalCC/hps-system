Function signature: 688ac6268430b453c3ca87ba80fb648cfbbf4b3b63dabdcbb2f8a76ed8fb685d

### Function Overview

The bash function `get_active_cluster_file` is used to get the contents of the active cluster configuration. It checks whether the link of the active cluster resides in `${HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_DIR}/active-cluster`. If the linked cluster is not active, the function throws an error. If the link fails to resolve, an error is reported. The function finally checks that the resolved target is a file. If it is not, an error message is thrown. If everything is correct, the function outputs the content of the cluster configuration file.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `get_active_cluster_file`
- **Description:** This function is used for retrieving the contents of the active cluster configuration from a specific directory. In case of errors, they will get thrown and displayed inside the terminal.
- **Globals:** [ `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_DIR`: Directory containing cluster configuration ]
- **Arguments:** None
- **Outputs:** Contents of `cluster.conf` file or an error message
- **Returns:** Returns 1 in case of error, otherwise doesnâ€™t explicitly return anything.
- **Example usage:** `get_active_cluster_file`


### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. The function could benefit from more precise error messages that give further details about the type of error encountered, hence making debugging easier.
2. Implementing a function to check the legitimacy of the 'active cluster' prior to it being used, could improve security.
3. It is suggested to sanitize any outputs to avoid injections or misuse of representatives.
4. Implementing logging for errors can provide better insights for future debugging and better maintainability.
5. Security could further be enhanced by checking the permissions and ownership of the file before trying to read it.
6. The failed attempts to access the configuration file should be limited to protect from potential brute-force attempts.
