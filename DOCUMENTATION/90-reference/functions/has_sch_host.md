Function signature: 379b6704d9af414555293ef691b70449d39306ef567e44aabf9ef70f91fa692d

##### Function Overview

The function `has_sch_host()` is designed to ascertain if there exists at least one host with a 'SCH' type within the specified host configuration directory. In case the directory is not present, the function outputs an error message and terminates with an exit status of 1. If the host of 'SCH' type is found, the function returns an exit status of 0 indicating a successful find. Conversely, if no such host entry is found, the function returns an exit status of 1, indicating failure to find any 'SCH' type hosts.

##### Technical Description

**Name:** `has_sch_host`

**Description:** This function checks for at least one host with 'SCH' type in a host configuration directory.

**Globals:** 

- `HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR`: This global variable represents the path to the host configuration directory.

**Arguments:** No argument is expected for this function.

**Outputs:** If the host configuration directory is not available, the function will output an error message: "\[x\] Host config directory not found: \<path_to_the_directory\>"

**Returns:** The function returns the following values based upon its operations:
* 0, if at least one host with 'SCH' type is found within the host configuration directory.
* 1, if the host configuration directory could not be found or if no such 'SCH' type hosts are found.

**Example Usage:**

```
source script_containing_has_sch_host
HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR="/path/to/host/config/dir"
has_sch_host

### It will return 0 if 'SCH' type host is found or 1 otherwise.
```

##### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Use of `local` for variable scope: Local scope is great, but this could be elevated by examining whether the use of `local` here is appropriate or if `declare` might better serve the purpose to prevent variable masking.
2. Explicit variable naming: The variable name `host_dir` might benefit from being a bit more descriptive, e.g., `targetHostDir`.
3. Error handling: Pay attention to error handling for the `grep` command as well. There could be situations where the `grep` command might fail.
4. Security: If `HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR` can be controlled by an external user, it's theoretically possible to craft a path that leads to unsafe areas. Examine and sanitize if needed.
5. Efficiency: The script uses `grep`, which is fine, but to improve speed, consider using built-in shell scripting commands or tools, which are usually faster than spawning a new process to run `grep`.
