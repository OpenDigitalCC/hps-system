### Function Overview

The function `remote_cluster_variable` is essentially used for manipulating the cluster variable in a remote Bash environment. It enables both the reading (GET) and writing (SET) of a cluster variable over HTTP, through a POST or GET request. The function communicates with the server via curl and utilizes a gateway system as the intermediary node for communicating with the remote cluster. The variable's value is URL-encoded before it's sent, ensuring its safe passage across the network.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `remote_cluster_variable`
- **Description:** The function manages a cluster variable in a remote bash environment. If two arguments are provided, it sets (POSTs) the specified value of the variable. If only one argument is provided, it gets (GETs) the value of the variable.
- **Globals:** None
- **Arguments:** `$1: name` (The name of the variable. If it's not provided, the function raises an error and terminates), `$2: value` (The value to set to the variable. This argument is optional. If it's provided, function sets (POSTs) this value to the variable. If it's not provided, function gets (GETs) value of the variable)
- **Outputs:** The function outputs the response from the POST or GET request.
- **Returns:** Returns 1 if there's an error in `get_provisioning_node` function. Otherwise, nothing is returned explicitly.
- **Example Usage:**
   ```bash
   remote_cluster_variable username john
   remote_cluster_variable username
   ```
   
### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Always URL encode all inputs to prevent potential security threats such as injection attacks.
2. Error checking for all variable assignments and function calls should be implemented for greater resilience.
3. Consider implementing retry logic for the curl command, as network requests are oftentimes flaky and may need to be retried.
4. Implement logging to catch and debug potential errors during runtime.
5. Make sure that the gateway system, being the relay of data, is secure against possible threats.
6. Validation for the user-inputted name and value, such as type or format restrictions, could be considered.
7. Always use HTTPS for such requests to ensure the privacy and data integrity of your communications.
