### Function overview

The `resolve_alpine_dependencies()` Bash function takes two arguments, `apkindex_file` and `package_name`. Its primary purpose is to parse an APKINDEX file corresponding to an Alpine Linux package repository, extract information relating to a specific package and its dependencies from the file, and print the details to standard output. Specifically, it extracts the package name, its version, and its associated dependencies, skipping over any shared library or file dependencies. It then recursively resolves and lists the dependencies for each of these package dependencies.

### Technical description

- __Name__: `resolve_alpine_dependencies`
- __Description__: This function reads an APKINDEX file and recursively prints a list of the input package name's dependencies. It checks if the APKINDEX file exists and whether the package exists in the APKINDEX. For each found package it extracts its name and version and if there are dependencies, it recursively calls itself to resolve these dependencies.
- __Globals__: ['hps_log: Function for logging']
- __Arguments__: 
  - `$1: APKINDEX file path`
  - `$2: Alpine Linux package name`
- __Outputs__: Corresponding filename for each resolved dependency package along with error messages related to the package resolution process. Outputs will be printed on stdout.
- __Returns__: It returns '1' in case of errors, like if the APKINDEX file or the package doesn't exists. There's no successful return value ('0'), function output is meant to be captured from stdout.
- __Example usage__: `resolve_alpine_dependencies "/path/to/APKINDEX" "package_name"`

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Implement a method for throwing errors instead of returning '1' when any occur.
2. Add error handlers to check whether `$1` and `$2` have been provided when the function is called.
3. Extend error handling to deal with cases in which a dependency package is not found in the APKINDEX file.
4. Increase the robustness of the function by validating APKINDEX content format.
5. Add more logging messages to provide insight into the function's execution and progression, especially during the recursive traversal of dependencies.
6. Use a more efficient and error-proof method than `echo` and `grep` chains for extracting field value.
7. Implement a limit on recursive depth to avoid potential problems with cyclic dependencies.
