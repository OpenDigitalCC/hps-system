Function signature: 1febc38504cbf3c2f9e3c9454db03a4906bf3c248c462581bd42ab50e69d0296

### Function overview

The `iscsi_targetcli_export()` is a Bash function part of the iSCSI protocol used for block-level storage traffic management between server and client in a network. This function creates a block-based backstore, an iSCSI target, a Logical Unit Number (LUN), sets the iSCSI target parameters, creates the portal listening on the specified IP address and port, and saves the getConfigureduration.

### Technical description

- Name: `iscsi_targetcli_export`
- Description: It executes a sequence of targetcli commands to create an iSCSI target with a block-based backstore and certain attributes. The target and portal creation can be conditional based on the new_target flag.
- Globals: 
  - None
- Arguments: 
  - `$1`: The IQN (iSCSI Qualified Name) for the iSCSI target
  - `$2`: The path to the zvol block device
  - `$3`: Backstore name
  - `$4`: IP address to bind for this iSCSI target
  - `$5`: Port to bind for this iSCSI target
  - `$6`: Flag to indicate new target (Value: 1) or existing target (Value: 0)
- Outputs: None
- Returns: None. However, if an error occurs within `targetcli` commands being executed, the error will be written to stderr by `targetcli`.
- Example usage:
```bash
iscsi_targetcli_export "iqn.2022-01.com.example:target1" "/dev/zvol1" "backstore1" "192.168.1.10" "3260" "1"
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Implement error checking and input validation: Currently, the function doesn't check if the provided arguments are valid. Input validation to ensure valid IQN, Zvol path, IP address, etc. can help mitigate errors and enhance the function reliability.

2. Sanitize all inputs: To prevent any command injection or arbitrary command execution, all inputs should be properly sanitized, especially when they're being directly used in command-string construction as in this function.

3. Handle `targetcli` command errors: The function doesnâ€™t handle any errors that may arise during the command execution. Error handling or exit codes from all `targetcli` commands can greatly improve the robustness of the function.

4. Logging: Implement extensive logging to capture all activities and errors. This is crucial for troubleshooting and system auditing.

5. Consider explicit return values: Right now there are no explicit return values. Providing explicit return values (return 0 upon success or a unique non-zero value upon each type of error) would make this function more reusable by other scripts/functions.
