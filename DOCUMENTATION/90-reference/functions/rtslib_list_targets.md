Function signature: 6e4bf5d3b011e59cd3a4346f13ded587844ffead7fe935f5f5e08c258f5d737e

### Function Overview

The `rtslib_list_targets` function is a Bash function that is used to list all the target World Wide Names (WWNs) in the fabric module "iscsi". The function uses Python3 code embedded in a Bash function to interact with the RTS (Runtime Simple) library.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `rtslib_list_targets`
- **Description:** This function is designed to list all the target WWNs in the fabric module named "iscsi". Internally, it uses a small Python3 script that utilizes the `RTSRoot` class from the `rtslib_fb` (RTS Library Full-Blown) module. This class provides an interface to the root of the RTS configuration model. The function iterates through each target of the RTS root, checks if its fabric module's name is "iscsi", and if so, prints its WWN.
- **Globals:** None.
- **Arguments:** None.
- **Outputs:** Prints the WWNs of all targets in the "iscsi" fabric module to stdout.
- **Returns:** None. Outputs are sent directly to stdout.
- **Example Usage:** To use this function, simply source it in your bash script and call it without any arguments. The function will print the output to stdout, so you may wish to capture that in a variable or pipe it to another command for further processing:
      ```sh
      source rtslib_list_targets.sh
      rtslib_list_targets
      ```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

Here are some suggestions to improve the quality and security of the function:

1. **Input Validation:** Even though this function does not accept any arguments, checking for unexpected inputs is always a good habit. Always make sure that the environment in which you are running your script is safe and secure.
   
2. **Error Handling:** Add error handling to the function to deal with potential issues that may arise, such as failure to import the required Python module or issues accessing the RTS configuration root.

3. **Documentation:** Enhance the code readability by adding more comments within the function explaining what each line or block of code is meant to do.

4. **Security:** This function operates with the RTS configuration model and may have effects on the network configuration. Make sure it is only operative under necessary permissions and not susceptible to unauthorized execution.
