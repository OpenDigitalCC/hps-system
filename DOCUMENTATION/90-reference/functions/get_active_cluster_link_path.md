Contained in `lib/functions.d/cluster-functions.sh`

Function signature: 00422606e36c805412e226764ea91ac8d9620442c34f9c3bf83c8de949497756

### 1. Function Overview

The function `get_active_cluster_link_path` is used to echo an active cluster link path existing in the `${HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR}` directory. It is specifically designed to get the path for the current active cluster configuration file within a High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster environment. This function does not accept any arguments or modify any global variables.

### 2. Technical Description

#### Name
`get_active_cluster_link_path`

#### Description
The `get_active_cluster_link_path` function is used to output the path of the active cluster config file. It does this by appending the string "active-cluster" to the `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR` environment variable using forward slash (/) as the separator to build the file path for the active cluster config file.

#### Globals 
[ `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR`: The directory containing the cluster config files ]

#### Arguments
This function does not require any arguments.

#### Outputs
The output is a string indicating the path of the active cluster config file. Example: `/path/to/HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR/active-cluster`

#### Returns
This function will return 0 on successful execution.

#### Example Usage
```bash
  # Get the path of the active cluster config file
  active_cluster_path=$(get_active_cluster_link_path)
  echo ${active_cluster_path}
```

### 3. Quality and Security Recommendations

1. This function does not perform any error checking. Therefore, it's recommended to add error handling to deal with the situation where `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR` might not be set or could be set to an invalid directory.
2. Confirm that the `active-cluster` file actually exists before attempting to return its path.
3. Protect against Command Injection attacks by sanitizing `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR` if it's externally controlled data.
4. Always quote your variables - in this case `${HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR}` - to avoid word splitting and globbing. This is important if there are spaces or special characters in the names.
5. Consider adding comments to explain what the function is doing a bit more clearly, especially if other people who are not familiar with the code will be reading or maintaining it.
