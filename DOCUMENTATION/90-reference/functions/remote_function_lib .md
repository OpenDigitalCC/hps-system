Function signature: b6d9cd335e4f61b186f614aa07279b2f8bdd77298bf573a231ffd21869c18118

### 1. Function Overview

The `remote_function_lib` function is designed for assembling functions to be injected into pre and post sections of certain scripts. It does this by using a technique called "here document" or `heredoc`, denoted by the `<<EOF` syntax. This is generally used to reduce the need for invoking echo repeatedly or for creating a temporary file containing the lines of text. This function in particular does not do anything else yet and waits for the user to fill in the necessary details.

### 2. Technical Description

- **Name**: `remote_function_lib`
- **Description**: This function is a placeholder for functions to be injected into pre and post sections of a script. It deploys a `heredoc` approach for adding lines of text.
- **Globals**: None
- **Arguments**: None
- **Outputs**: Outputs a block of text that is written between the EOF markers.
- **Returns**: Depending on the usage (not specified in the provided function details).
- **Example usage**: 
```bash
source remote_function_lib
```

> **Note:** For actual usage, the function injected within this `heredoc` should be implemented first.

### 3. Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Be mindful while using `heredocs`. If not properly utilized, sensitive data may be inadvertently written to a file and may remain there even after the script has finished.
2. As this function is passive and doesn't perform any actions except print to standard output, ensure that the functionality it provides is actually needed in your script.
3. Consider using functions as external files for better organization, modularity, and error handling.
4. Always validate and sanitize input to functions; although this function doesn't take any inputs, it's a good general practice.
5. Include comments to thoroughly explain the details of the function, its inputs, outputs, and what it specifically does.
6. Also consider handling possible errors and return suitable error codes/messages for better debugging.
