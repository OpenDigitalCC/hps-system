Function signature: d3d22d399af4c7c80fb8449bf421c864014acf615622669621bd6f5a2999ef5e

### Function overview

The `create_config_nginx` shell function is designed to create and set up a configuration file for the nginx server. It begins by sourcing the active cluster file (if it exists) and defining the path for nginx's configuration file. The function then uses a heredoc (`<<EOF`) to write the server configurations, including worker processes, user and events into the nginx configuration file.

### Technical description

**Name:** `create_config_nginx`

**Description:** This function creates an nginx configuration file with appropriate server settings.

**Globals:** There is one global variable that this function interacts with:
- `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR`: The directory in which the nginx configuration file is located.

**Arguments:** This function accepts no arguments.

**Outputs:** This function outputs an `info` level log message about the configuration of nginx server.

**Returns:** The function doesn't return any explicit value, since its primary task is writing to a file. If this operation is successful, it will implicitly return `0`. Else, it will return whatever error code is thrown by the failing command inside the function.

**Example usage:** 

```bash
create_config_nginx
```

### Quality and security recommendations
1. Implement a feature to validate the nginx configuration file after it's been written. The `nginx -t` command could be used for this.
2. Consider using strict mode (`set -euo pipefail`) to handle potential errors.
3. Add descriptive comments to the script for easier understanding and debugging.
4. Configure the function to accept inputs such as worker_processes, user, worker_connections as arguments so it can be used more flexibly.
5. Use ShellCheck (or a similar linter tool) to analyze the script for potential issues related to robustness, portability, and maintainability.
6. Implement error handling. For example, check whether the `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR` directory exists before trying to write to it.
7. Consider encrypting sensitive information that might appear in logs or configuration files.
