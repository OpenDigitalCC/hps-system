Function signature: 63d87412289beb590b23dead3edfbcd2afb85d4ee141526d80e8ad9104dcfbcb

##### Function Overview 

The following function, `verify_rocky_checksum_signature`, is designed to download and validate the checksum of Rocky Linux iso files by leveraging the accompanying gpg signature. The function performs several actions: it first downloads the checksum and the corresponding signature. It then imports the official Rocky Linux GPG key. Afterward, it verifies the signature against the checksum file. Finally, it extracts the expected checksum from the file and matches it to the actual checksum of the iso. If the checksum are identical, the function will signify successful verification.

##### Technical Description 

- Name: `verify_rocky_checksum_signature`
- Description: This function primarily aims to download and authenticate the Rocky Linux iso files via the associated gpg signature.
- Globals: [ HPS_DISTROS_DIR: The directory where the distributions are stored ]
- Arguments: [ $1: Specifies the version of Rocky Linux ]
- Outputs: Status messages regarding the actions performed (downloading checksum and signature, importing GPG keys, verifying checksum)
- Returns: 0 if GPG signature and checksum are both verified successfully, otherwise returns 1, 2, 3 or 4 depending on the specific error
- Example usage:  
  ```bash
  verify_rocky_checksum_signature "8.5"
  ```
##### Quality and Security Recommendations 

1. Make proper use of quoting: Variables should always be contained within double quotes in case they contain special characters (for example, spaces).
2. Ensure you are relying on trusted sources: The function downloads scripts from the internet, but always be sure you trust the source before running a script.
3. Check for error conditions: The function does check for error conditions and reports results, which is good.
4. Avoid suppressing errors: The use of `2>/dev/null` suppresses important error messages. A better practice is to handle all possible exceptions or errors.
5. Consider adding more comments: Useful comments can help others understand the purpose and function of your code.
6. Handle command failures: The function should stop executing as soon as any of the commands fails. This will prevent the condition where a failure leaves the system in an indeterminate state. Use `set -e` or check the status of each command manually. 
7. Use updated cryptographic standards: Always use updated secure algorithms (like SHA-256) during verification.
