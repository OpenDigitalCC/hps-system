### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Always pass a non-empty string as the `title` parameter to avoid generating headers with no titles.
2. Keep the usage of the function within safe environments since it directly outputs to the terminal without any security check.
3. For better readability, avoid using very long strings as `title`. The title should be concise and clear.
4. The function doesn't handle errors or exceptions, so ensure the inputs are well formatted and appropriate.
