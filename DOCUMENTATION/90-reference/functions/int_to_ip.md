### Function overview

The function `int_to_ip()` is used to convert an integer into an IP address. The function performs bitwise shifting and masking operations on the integer input to generate the corresponding IP address. This function is further utilized within a looping structure to generate IP addresses within a range and attempts to assign an IP address, which is not already found within a configuration directory. The function also generates hostnames in a specific format and assigns these IP addresses and hostnames to a host configuration based on a specified "macid".

### Technical description

- **Name:** `int_to_ip()`
- **Description:** This function converts an integer into an IP address (IPv4).
- **Globals:** 
  - `HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR`: Configuration directory for host systems.
  - `max`: Maximum number of IPs to look up. Default is 254.
  - `network base`: Base IP for a network on which the computation starts.
- **Arguments:** 
  - `$1`: This is the integer value to be converted to an IP address.
- **Outputs:** This function outputs an IP address that corresponds to the input integer.
- **Returns:** The function does not explicitly return a value, but assigns an IP and hostnames to a host based on a specified "macid".
- **Example Usage:** `int_to_ip $((base_int + i))`

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Improve error handling: More robust checks should be instituted to manage potential issues related to failed IP or hostname generation.
2. Consider adding checks to ensure the provided integer for `int_to_ip()` function in a valid range corresponding to possible IP addresses.
3. Security consideration: Avoid storing MAC addresses and IPs in plaintext configurations. Consider using a secure method or encryption while storing or transmitting these details.
4. Make use of more descriptive variable names to enhance the function's readability and maintainability.
5. Consider implementing limit checks on the sequential generation of IP addresses and host names to prevent potentially infinitely running loops.
