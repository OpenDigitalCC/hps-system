### Function overview

The `int_to_ip` bash function plays a crucial role in the management of host configurations, particularly for setting up IP addresses and hostnames. This function is primarily used for converting an integer into an IP address. The function first generates a unique IP address that is not already in use. It then proceeds to create a unique hostname. If the function fails to generate either a unique IP address or a unique hostname, it logs a debug message and exits with a return code 1, indicating an error.

### Technical description

- **Name:** `int_to_ip`
- **Description:** Transforms an integer into an IP address format. It is part of a larger script where it helps to assign unique IP addresses and hostnames for host configurations.
- **Globals:** [ `HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR`: A directory containing host configuration files ]
- **Arguments:** [ `$1`: a four-part decimal number (0-255) representing an IPv4 address ]
- **Outputs:** Returns a unique IP address and hostname, unless encountered an error during the process.
- **Returns:** `1` if it fails to either generate a unique IP or a unique hostname. If successful, it executes a series of `host_config` calls to set various attributes of a specified host.
- **Example usage:**
```bash
$ int_to_ip 167772119 
Output: 10.0.0.15
```
```bash
$ int_to_ip 3232235775 
Output: 192.168.1.255
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. It's strongly recommended to sanitize and validate the inputs especially if they are coming from an external source to prevent command injection attacks.
2. To improve error handling, consider emitting meaningful error messages instead of just logging debug messages.
3. In its current state, the function could be more robust if it handled probable errors that might occur when shifting and bitwise-anding the input.
4. For better readability and maintainability, consider refactoring the function to smaller, standalone functions that carry out specific tasks.
5. It would be wise to implement check to ensure the directory `HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR` exists and is accessible before running any related commands.
