### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Consider validating the input data, if it is an integer and in the acceptable range.
2. Implement error handling for improper input or unexpected output.
3. Be cautious about information leakages or unwanted side effects due to globally scoped variables.
4. Consider implementing some form of logging for debugging and traceability of function.
5. Adopt defensive coding practices across the board to ensure that potential misuse of code does not result in compromising the system.
