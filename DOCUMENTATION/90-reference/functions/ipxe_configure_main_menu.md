### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. To avoid shell injection, never pass untrusted input to eval, the system, or others unless you've properly sanitized it.
2. Use `"$@"` instead of `"$*"` to correctly handle parameters with spaces or special characters.
3. You should ensure that any local variables that should not be exported to global scope are not inadvertently exported.
4. Check for the existence and the type of commands before invoking them.
5. Include error checking for every command that can feasibly fail.
6. Use a consistent style in your code to ensure better readability and maintainability.
