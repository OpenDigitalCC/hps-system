Function signature: cf6f48116ee4f6ae2fa075ed74a4476f6c22ffe594564ebf704d40d3dce09039

##### 1. Function overview

The function `write_cluster_config` is designed to write a set of provided values into a specified target file as a cluster configuration. If no values are supplied, the function will return an error message indicating that an empty cluster configuration cannot be written. If values are provided, they will be written to the target file and a confirmation message will be displayed.

##### 2. Technical description

- **Name**: `write_cluster_config`
- **Description**: The `write_cluster_config` function takes a filename and a series of values as arguments. It writes these values into the given filename. If no values are provided, the function will display an error message and halt operation.
- **Globals**: None.
- **Arguments**: 
  - `$1`: The target file into which the configuration values should be written. 
  - `$@`: The values, passed as an array, that should be written into the cluster configuration.
- **Outputs**: An error message if no values are provided, a logging message of what is being written, and a success message upon successful write.
- **Returns**: 1 if no values are provided for writing, otherwise no explicit return.
- **Example usage**: Assume an array `arr=("value1" "value2" "value3")`. We can call `write_cluster_config "target.txt" "${arr[@]}"`

##### 3. Quality and security recommendations

1. Escape the output using secure methods to prevent possible command injection vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior.
2. Implement error handling if the target_file does not exist or cannot be written to.
3. Add checks to ensure the validity of the values to be written to the file.
4. Implement logging system to keep track of the function operations.
5. Utilize secure temporary files during operations to avoid inadvertent exposure of potentially sensitive data.
6. Add testing routines to ensure the function behaves as expected under a variety of conditions.
