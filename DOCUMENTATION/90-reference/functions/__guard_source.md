### Function overview
The function `__guard_source()` is a utility within Bash scripting that helps in preventing a source file from being included and executed more than once. When calling a script source file that has already been loaded, the function immediately returns to prevent duplicated execution.

### Technical description
- **Name:** __guard_source()
- **Description:** This function prevents a source file from being executed multiple times in a Bash script. It achieves this by creating a unique variable based on the filename of the source file being called, checking if it already exists, and returning if it does.
- **Globals:** None
- **Arguments:** None
- **Outputs:** None
- **Returns:** 1 if the source file has already been included, 0 if it is the first time.
- **Example usage:**

  ```bash
  source ./myscript.sh
  __guard_source
  ```

### Quality and security recommendations
1. **Input validation:** The function should validate if the value of `${BASH_SOURCE[1]}` exists and is a valid source file before attempting to process it.
2. **Error handling:** The function should have clear error handling and messaging when the source file does not exist or is not accessible.
3. **Security:** Use of the `declare` keyword can lead to code injections if not properly handled. Make sure the input source file name can't be arbitrarily set by the user.
4. **Documentation:** Make sure to properly comment the code to provide a better understanding of what the function does and how it works.
5. **Testing:** Unit test cases should be written to test the function's behavior under different conditions and with a variety of source file names. This will ensure that the function behaves as expected and will catch any errors or issues that might arise in the future.
