### Function overview
The function `osvc_apply_identity_from_hps()` retrieves values from a local configuration file `/etc/opensvc/opensvc.conf` and sets identity information for the node and the cluster. It also checks if the required files are readable, and if necessary values are retrievable from configuration. Any errors or warning are logged through the `hps_log` function.

### Technical description
**name:** osvc_apply_identity_from_hps

**description:** This function retrieves nodename from configuration, sets the nodename as `node.name` if nodename is `ips`. Then it retrieves the cluster name and sets it as `cluster.name`. It logs various error and warning messages if necessary. 

**globals:**
- conf: Path of the configuration file. Default `/etc/opensvc/opensvc.conf`

**arguments:** are not used in this function.

**outputs:** Logs messages in case of various error and warning states. Messages include missing configuration file, nodename not found, failed attempt to set node.name or cluster.name, and CLUSTER_NAME not found.

**returns:**
- 0 if an function executes without finding error states.
- 1 if `/etc/opensvc/opensvc.conf` is not readable or nodename is not found in the configuration.

**example usage:**
```bash
osvc_apply_identity_from_hps
```

### Quality and security recommendations
1. Handle other error exceptions which can include failing of `_osvc_kv_set` function or `_ini_get_agent_nodename`. 
2. Provide more explicit error messages to aid in debugging.
3. Use plain English in log messages for better understanding and potential internationalization later on.
4. Consider limiting the potential impact of command execution through validation and sanitization.
5. Although it appears the function is designed to be run as root (given the hard-coded file path), ensure appropriate permissions are in place and that sensitive data is adequately protected.
