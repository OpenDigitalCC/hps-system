### Quality and security recommendations
1. Consider better error handling: instead of returning a binary (0/1) success/failure status, use different return values for different types of errors to help callers diagnose problems.
2. Validate inputs: As this script uses external HPS configs, ensure that these configuration inputs are valid and safe to protect against configuration errors or potential security risks like command injection.
3. Add comment explanation for the complex commands or steps to enhance the code's readability and maintainability.
4. Use consistent error messaging: Consistently structure error messages to make them easier to understand and to help with troubleshooting.
5. Add detailed logging: To enhance traceability and debugging, log the beginning and end of each operation, as well as any exceptions or unexpected conditions.
