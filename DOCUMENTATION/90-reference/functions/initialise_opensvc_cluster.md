Function signature: 93541cb524c5002ddf32259cf012379871affcf44fd786a4ff1def822ad2aaff

### Function overview
The function `initialise_opensvc_cluster` is responsible for the initiation of an OpenSVC cluster. The function first logs the initiation process, then reads the desired values from HPS configs. If a required variable `CLUSTER_NAME` is not found, the function aborts the process and returns `1`. The function lowercases the `TYPE` tag value and sets the cluster name and node tags appropriately. Near the end, it checks if the `systemctl` command exists and then proceeds to restart the OpenSVC daemon. If restarting fails, the function throws a warning and returns `1`. Otherwise, the function ends by logging the successful completion of OpenSVC cluster initialization.

### Technical description
**Name:** `initialise_opensvc_cluster`  

**Description:** This function is used to initialize an OpenSVC cluster. It controls and logs the process of configuration retrieval, validation, cluster setting, tag setting, and daemon (service) restarting. It logs a warning if the OpenSVC daemon restart fails, and a success message if the initialization completes.  

**Globals:** None  

**Arguments:** None  

**Outputs:** Logs messages about the cluster initialization process, including errors and successful initialization.  

**Returns:** `0` if successful, `1` otherwise.  

**Example usage:**
```bash
initialise_opensvc_cluster
```

### Quality and security recommendations
1. It's a good practice to declare and initialize all local variables at the top of a function to promote readability and reduce errors.
2. Although this function does not take any arguments or use global variables, it is important to check and validate any input data if this changes in the future.
3. Try to handle errors as close as possible to where they occur. Explicitly checking the return values of commands and handling errors can make code easier to understand and debug.
4. Avoid suppressing error outputs unless it's a must. It's better to redirect them to a log file for future debugging.
5. Querying the OpenSVC daemon could have security implications. Therefore, proper security controls should be installed to avoid potential system vulnerabilities.
6. Always ensure you have permission to execute commands before running them.
7. Be very mindful of the environment variables, files and directories you are manipulating. Any mishandling could adversely affect system integrity.
