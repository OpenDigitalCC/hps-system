### Function Overview

This bash function, `load_cluster_host_type_profiles()`, is designed to load the configuration files corresponding to the host types within a particular active cluster. The function operates by reading the key-value pairs from the active configuration file and storing them in an associative array for each declared host type.


### Technical Description

- **Name**: load_cluster_host_type_profiles
- **Description**: This function reads an active cluster's configuration file and populates an associative array for each declared host type with key-value pairs from the file.
- **Globals**: [ __declared_types: This global associative array stores the host type declarations. ]
- **Arguments**: None
- **Outputs**: If no errors occur, it outputs nothing; however, to stderr, it'll output any error encountered during the process if the configuration file doesn't exist. It takes each key-value pair from the file and adds it to an associated array corresponding to the host type.
- **Returns**: If the configuration file does not exist, it returns 1; otherwise, it doesn't return a value.
- **Example Usage**: load_cluster_host_type_profiles
  

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. It is always a good idea to add more error checking. For example, this function will fail in silence if the configuration file does not have the right format. It could be improved with more feedback for incorrect format.
   
2. Regarding security aspects, it is suggested to add a security layer when opening and reading the file. An attacker could replace the content of the configuration file and this function would process it without any validation.
   
3. The function will process any key-value pair from configured hosts, including possibly non-expected pairs. It could be a good idea to validate the keys and values are expected and not a possible injection attempt.
   
4. It's always recommended to limit the global scope of variables. A better approach could be returning the processed data to the caller function instead of storing it in a global array. This would make the function safer and easier to maintain and debug.
