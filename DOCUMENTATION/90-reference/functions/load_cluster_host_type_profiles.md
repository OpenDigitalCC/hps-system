##### 1. Function Overview

This bash function, `load_cluster_host_type_profiles()`, is responsible for loading cluster host type profiles from a configuration file. The function reads from the active cluster configuration file (which name is retrieved by `get_active_cluster_filename()` function) and declares the host types with their corresponding key-value pairs. These key-value pairs are then stored in a global associative array. If the configuration file does not exist, the function returns 1 without any execution.

##### 2. Technical Description

**Function Name:** `load_cluster_host_type_profiles`

**Description:** This function reads from an active cluster's configuration file and creates a set of declared host types with their corresponding key-value pairs. This information is then stored in a global associative array for later use.

**Global Variables:** 

- `__declared_types`: holds an associative array of declared types of hosts.

**Arguments:** None.

**Outputs:** If successful, the global associative array, `__declared_types` is populated with host types and their corresponding key-value pairs from the active cluster configuration file. 

**Returns:** If the configuration file does not exist, the function returns `1`. Otherwise, it doesn't return a specific value.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
load_cluster_host_type_profiles
```

##### 3. Quality And Security Recommendations

1. All crucial actions like creating files or reading from them should have error handling to ensure no unexpected behavior occurs.
2. Variables such as `config_file` should be properly sanitized to prevent potential code injection attacks.
3. A detailed and meaningful error message should be provided if the active cluster configuration file is absent.
4. Implement file access permission check for the configuration file to avoid unauthorized changes.
5. If the function is going to be used in multi-threaded scenarios, proper measures should be taken to avoid data races and inconsistencies concerning global variable `__declared_types`.
