Function signature: e8b75e07393214cde63dd915f2b27bd51eaa5da11579a076a828811824842d0e

### 1. Function Overview

The `generate_opensvc_conf()` function is primarily used to generate the configuration file for the OpenSVC agent node. The configuration includes host-based parameters as well as cluster-based parameters. Based on the input parameter (ips_role) and specific system details, the function sets various variables such as `osvc_type`, `osvc_nodename`, and `osvc_tags`. It then retrieves cluster parameters from cluster config, sets certain static paths and finally, constructs the OpenSVC configuration.

### 2. Technical Description

- Name: `generate_opensvc_conf`
- Description: Generates OpenSVC agent node's configuration file based on host specs and cluster configuration.
- Globals: 
  - `origin`: refers to the origin subsystem of the program.
  - `osvc_nodename`: refers to the hostname of the OpenSVC node.
  - `osvc_type`: refers to the type of OpenSVC node.
  - `osvc_tags`: refers to the tags associated with the OpenSVC node.
- Arguments: 
  - `$1: ips_role`: role of IPS; by default, it's empty.
- Outputs: Writes the generated configuration to stdout.
- Returns: Doesn't explictly return a value; instead outputs the configuration data directly.
- Example Usage:
  - `generate_opensvc_conf "provisioning"`

### 3. Quality and Security Recommendations

1. The function code should more explicitly handle error cases, especially when attempting to retrieve host or cluster configuration. 
2. Sanitize inputs and outputs to prevent attacks such as code injection or output redirection.
3. If possible, use existing system or language features or libraries to validate and parse configuration files instead of writing custom logic.
4. Consider encrypting sensitive pieces of the configuration.
5. Do not hardcode default values, instead they should be defined as global constants at the beginning of the script or even better, in a separate configuration file or environment variable. This will improve maintainability and security.
6. Always keep your shell scripts and dependent packages up to date with the latest security patches.
7. Document any updates to the code clearly and thoroughly to ensure it's easily understandable by other developers.
