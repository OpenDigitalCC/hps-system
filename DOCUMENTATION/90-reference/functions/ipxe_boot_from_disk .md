##### Function overview
The function `ipxe_boot_from_disk` is designed to boot from a local disk through the bios by terminating the iPXE stack. This function is part of the iPXE pre-boot execution environment system, which allows network boot from a client system. It functions by displaying a message ("Handing back to BIOS to boot") and then delays for 5 seconds prior to exiting the function, effectively leading to the BIOS booting.

##### Quality and security recommendations
1. A validation procedure should be put in place to confirm the completion of the iPXE boot. This ensures that the BIOS boot is not initiated erroneously, causing a reboot loop.
2. Increase delay if required. The 5-second delay might not be enough in some systems, making it useful to include an optional delay argument.
3. Implement logging mechanism to ensure the function can be debugged and monitored.
4. Consider implementing an error-handling structure to manage potential execution failures. This could help in diagnosing and resolving issues more effectively.
5. Echoing the communications or actions to the end-user without any validation or filtration might pose a security risk. Therefore, sanitization of outputs is recommended.
