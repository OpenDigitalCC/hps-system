##### 1. Function Overview

The function `ipxe_show_info()` is a bash function that shows host, iPXE system, cluster configuration and system paths information based on the category provided. Upon calling the function, it takes in a category (i.e., `show_ipxe`, `show_cluster`, `show_host`, or `show_paths`) and displays the corresponding information. If a path or necessary file is missing it will indicate this to the user.

##### 2. Technical description

- **Name:** `ipxe_show_info()`
- **Description:** This function displays information about iPXE system, host, cluster configuration and system paths based on the category provided.
- **Globals:** [ `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_DIR`: This is the directory where the cluster configuration files are stored.
`HPS_CONFIG`: This is the configuration file for HPS.]
- **Arguments:** [ `$1`: The category of information to be displayed. It can be `show_ipxe`, `show_cluster`, `show_host`, or `show_paths` ]
- **Outputs:** Prints the iPXE system information, host information, cluster configuration or system paths based on the argument provided to the function.
- **Returns:** Nothing.
- **Example usage:** `ipxe_show_info show_cluster`

##### 3. Quality and security recommendations

1. **Input validation:** Ensure that user inputs are properly validated to avoid unexpected behavior or output from the function. For instance, validating the `category` should only take the allowed arguments (`show_ipxe`, `show_cluster`, `show_host` or `show_paths`).
2. **Error Handling:** Provide clear and specific error messages for the end user. In case a configuration file is not found, provide guidance on next steps or tips on how to solve the issue.
3. **Documentation:** Keep the documentation of this function up to date, as it forms a critical part of the user guide.
4. **Security:** Be wary of command execution vulnerabilities if user input is ingested without validation or sanitization. In this function, make sure that the `category` input does not open up the potential for Command Injection. This is particularly important if additional components will be added to the system that calls this function and could open up new vulnerabilities.
5. **Code Quality:** While not directly related to security, maintaining good code quality is a standard best practice to keep a project maintainable and error free in the long term. Code quality refers to such things as ensuring consistent syntax style, comprehensive commenting, avoiding deeply nested loops or conditional (i.e., “spaghetti code”), and dividing code into modular, single-purpose units.
