### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Using globals in bash scripts should be avoided if possible. Globals are not thread-safe, and their values can be changed by any part of the code, making it hard to track bugs. 
2. The function lacks error handling. It would be advisable to include checks for possible point of failures like availability of network connection, validity of installation options, etc.
3. If the CGI_URL is created or modified in some other part of the code, ensure all the possible URL values are sanitized to prevent the possibility of code injection attacks.
4. Ensure that the communication between the servers in the network is encrypted to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks during the network boot process. 
5. Check that the file paths, networks addresses and other resources the script interacts with are properly secured with correct permissions. This prevents unauthorized access or changes to these resources.
