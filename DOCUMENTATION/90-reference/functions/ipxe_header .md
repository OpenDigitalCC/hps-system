### Function Overview

The `ipxe_header()` function transmits a pxe header to prevent boot failures. It establishes a series of variables for use in IPXE scripts, then outputs these to the console. 

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `ipxe_header`
- **Description:** The function initially transmits a pxe header to prevent any boot failures. It sets a couple of global variables (CGI_URL, TITLE_PREFIX) for use in IPXE scripts. The function constructs and prints a specific message structure.
- **Globals:** [ CGI_URL: The URL to the boot manager script running on the selected server, TITLE_PREFIX: The title prefix combining the cluster name, mac address, and network IP of the server ]
- **Arguments:** [ None ]
- **Outputs:** Console output which includes a log message, specifics about the server, and information about the client.
- **Returns:** No explicit return value. 
- **Example usage:** It's frequently used in the context of IPXE scripting and will typically be invoked without arguments, like so:
  ```bash
  ipxe_header
  ```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. It is crucial to double-check all inputs, specifically while fetching images over the network from a specified URL. This safeguard prevents possible vulnerabilities associated with potential malicious content.
2. All user data or potentially sensitive information output to the console should ideally be sanitized or selectively displayed, as it may expose critical information to malicious actors or risk leaking sensitive data.
3. It may be useful to add error handling to address potential failures that may occur throughout the execution of the function. For instance, if `cgi_header_plain` or `imgfetch` fail, there should be appropriate error messages and failure handling.
4. Increase the readability of the code by adding further comments regarding the functionality and working of different code blocks within the function.
