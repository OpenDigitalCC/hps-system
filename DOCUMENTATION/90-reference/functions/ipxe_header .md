##### Quality and security recommendations

1. It is important to properly validate the input for functions to prevent unwanted side effects or attacks. Thus, do ensure that input such as the server and client IP addresses are valid before they are used in server-side scripts.
2. Always use https:// prefix for `CGI_URL` if the data sent within the script is sensitive or important, as http:// is not secure.
3. Beware of command injection security vulnerabilities. All variables that are included in command line arguments should be properly escaped.
4. The function does not implement error checking or handling. It is recommended to handle possible error conditions to improve the robustness of the application. For instance, check if `cgi_header_plain` and `imgfetch` have executed successfully, and if not, throw a meaningful error message.
