### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Ensure that the host config and all command line arguments are properly sanitized to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
2. It would be useful to check the statuses of operations like 'host_config' and short circuit the execution of the function, in the event of an error.
3. Ensure that the logging mechanism in 'hps_log' properly sanitizes and escapes any string input to prevent log injection attacks.
4. As a quality improvement, among the menu items, 'Recover from Disaster Recovery Host (DRH)' is mentioned as 'NOT YET IMPLEMENTED'. Consider implementing this feature or removing it from the menu to avoid user confusion. 
5. For enhancing security while fetching the log, handle the failure case with more than just an echo statement. Prompt the user, or retry fetch.
