Function signature: 94e779d35f9a3f9fea90f859607c3903523d66e35f08f1be883ff3aeb13f8ede

### Function Overview

The `configure_supervisor_services` function acts as a configuration manager for supervisor services in Bash. The function takes a supervisord configuration file, located in the `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR` directory, and prepares it for desired supervisor services.

### Technical Description

**Function**: configure_supervisor_services

- **Description**: This function is mainly purposed with the responsibility of supervisor service configuration manipulations in Bash.

- **Globals**: `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR` - a global variable that specifies the directory path where the supervisord configuration file is located.

- **Arguments**: This function does not take any user-defined arguments and mainly operates using asserted global variables.

- **Outputs**: Adjustments of the indicated supervisord configuration file, particularized by the declared global variable.

- **Returns**: In typical scenarios, does not specifically return a single variable or object. This function rather operates by enforcing alterations on the indicated supervisord configuration file.

- **Example Usage**: While this process could generally be automated and as such hidden from disconnected user encounters, this function might be initiated as `configure_supervisor_services`, providing the `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR` global variable is defined beforehand.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. This function does not input or output sensitive data, which reduces risk, but as a good practice, any function interacting with files should check for file permissions. 
2. Adding error handlers for potential file access issues (e.g., file doesn't exist, or lack of the necessary permissions) would improve the quality.
3. To ensure script interruption upon errors, consider enabling the `set -e` parameter.
4. Make sure that the value of the `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR` global variable is set in a secure way, without exposing potential system vulnerabilities.
5. Although they don't specifically apply to this function, always sanitize inputs and ensure least privilege when dealing with files containing sensitive information.
