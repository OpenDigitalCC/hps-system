Function signature: 55fba2752d840b45670dcc10f8be084d3234f9c87a37a1959fcde6a9247be828

### Function Overview

The `build_yum_repo` function checks for changes in RPM packages inside a specified repository. If changes are detected or if there's no previous state, it uses the `createrepo_c` command to create or update the metadata for the YUM repository. Regardless of the outcome, a checksum of current state is stored for future comparison. Outputs and potential errors are reported using `hps_log` helper function.

### Technical Description

* **Name:** `build_yum_repo`
* **Description:** The function checks the RPM changes inside the provided repo path. If there are changes or no previous state, `createrepo_c` is used to create or update the repo metadata. Checksums of the current state are saved for future checks.
* **Globals:** None
* **Arguments:** `repo_path` ($1): the path to the repo that needs to be checked and updated.
* **Outputs:** Associated logs with `hps_log` displaying info about events and potential errors.
* **Returns:** 0 if no changes were made or repo created successfully, 1 if the repo path is not provided or doesn't exist, 2 if `createrepo_c` command is not found.
* **Example usage:** `build_yum_repo "${HPS_PACKAGES_DIR}/${DIST_STRING}/Repo"`

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Consider validating the checksum process and handling any exceptions it might throw. This can improve the function's quality and resilience.
2. Assert the existence of 'createrepo_c' command at the start of the function to fail early if it's not installed, this can save execution time.
3. Look into the security of the checksum generation. Make sure it is robust against potential risks such as spoofing or collision attacks.
4. Validate the structure and content of the repo path argument to prevent potential bugs or security issues related to wrong or malicious inputs.
