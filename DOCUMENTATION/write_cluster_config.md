### Quality and security recommendations
1. Include input validation: The function should include input validation to ensure the target file path and configuration values comply with expected formats.
2. Use secure methods for file handling: To prevent any security vulnerability, use secure methods for file manipulation.
3. Error handling: Include robust error handling after operations that may fail, like file write operation.
4. Logging: Consider adding logging for tracking and debugging purposes
