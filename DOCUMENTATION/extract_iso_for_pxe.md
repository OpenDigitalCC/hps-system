## `extract_iso_for_pxe`

Contained in `lib/functions.d/iso-functions.sh`

### Function overview
The bash shell function, `extract_iso_for_pxe`, controls the extraction process of ISO files relevant for PXE (Preboot Execution Environment). It employs a series of local variables and decision constructs to determine if the ISO file exists, if it has been previously extracted, and to handle the extraction process.

### Technical description
**Name:** 
`extract_iso_for_pxe`

**Description:** 
This function is designed to extract an ISO file for utilization in PXE. It first checks if the ISO file exists and whether it has been extracted before. If the necessary conditions are met, it extracts the ISO to a specified directory and then validates the extraction process.

**Globals:** 
`HPS_DISTROS_DIR: This global directs to the directory where distributions are located.`

**Arguments:** 
`
$1: The CPU identifier.
$2: The Manufacturer identifier.
$3: The Operating System name.
$4: The Operating System version.
`

**Outputs:**
It delivers textual output to describe the process' successes or failures, with details about the ISO location or potential issues.

**Returns:**
- 1 if the ISO file is not found or there is a failure in the extraction process.
- 0 if the ISO file has already been extracted, or the extraction process was successful.

**Example usage:**
```bash
extract_iso_for_pxe 'i386' 'HP' 'Ubuntu' '18.04'
```

### Quality and security recommendations
1. A check should be included to validate the incoming arguments to avoid unintended behavior or errors.
2. The use of quotation marks for variable expansion, such as `"$iso_file"`, is a good practice for preventing word splitting and pathname expansion. It should be used consistently in the entire script.
3. Provide a more detailed error message if the iso file not found to help the user in debugging.
4. Instead of using `echo` for standard error redirection (`>&2`), consider using `printf` which is safer and more portable.
5. For an extra layer of security, input validation could be enhanced, verifying that the supplied `cpu`, `mfr`, `osname` and `osver` conform to expected formats.
6. It may be beneficial to include logging at different steps, so that in the event of failure, a log file can be consulted to identify the issue.
