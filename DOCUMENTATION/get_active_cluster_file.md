## `get_active_cluster_file`

Contained in `lib/functions.d/cluster-functions.sh`

### Function Overview

The `get_active_cluster_file` function returns the contents of the active cluster config file in Bash programming. This function primarily works by linking to the active cluster config directory and checking if it contains a file named `cluster.conf`. If so, it returns the contents of that file. If not, it will return an error.

### Technical Description

- **name:** `get_active_cluster_file`
- **description:** This function is used to get the content of the active cluster config file. It checks if the symlink to the active cluster directory exists then it verifies if the symlink resolves to an existing file named `cluster.conf`. If these conditions are satisfied, it returns the content of `cluster.conf`.
- **globals:** [ `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_DIR`: This is the directory of the active cluster configuration ]
- **arguments:** [ `None.` ]
- **outputs:** Either outputs the contents of the active cluster config file, or an error message if the file could not be found or read.
- **returns:** It returns `1` if an error occurred. Otherwise, it doesn't return a specific value as it prints the output directly.
- **example usage:**
  ```bash
  get_active_cluster_file
  ```

### Quality and Security Recommendations
- Replace the hardcoded cluster.conf file name with a configurable variable.
- Include more specific error handling for each of the different possible points of failure.
- Regularly update the permissions on `cluster.conf` to ensure it can't be modified by unauthorized users.
- Guarantee the security of `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_DIR`, preventing unauthorized access and movement.
- Consider using more reliable methods such as `pushd` and `popd` instead of `cd` for directory changes to ensure path integrity.
- Always clean or sanitize outputs, particularly if they're being used in subsequent scripts or commands.
- Avoid showing full directory paths in error messages. This can potentially expose sensitive information about the server.
- Verify that $link is a symlink to a file, not to a directory or other type of file.
