## `bootstrap_initialise_distro`

Contained in `lib/functions.d/configure-distro.sh`

### 1. Function Overview

The `bootstrap_initialise_distro` function is primarily designed for system provisioning tasks in a Unix-based operating system (OS). This function initializes the OS distribution by injecting specific bootstrap instructions. It accepts a machine address (MAC) as a parameter and uses it to generate a shell script with bootstrap instructions.

### 2. Technical Description

- **Name:** `bootstrap_initialise_distro`
- **Description:** This function creates a bash script with bootstrap initialization instructions for a Unix-like OS. It uses a `cat` command to output a standard bash script header followed by specific bootstrapping instructions. A MAC address may be provided to customize the bootstrap instructions, although the current function version does not seem to be using this parameter.
- **Globals:** None
- **Arguments:** 

  - `$1: mac` The MAC address of the target machine

- **Outputs:** A bash script with bootstrap instructions
- **Returns:** No value returned
- **Example usage:** `bootstrap_initialise_distro "00:0a:95:9d:68:16"`

### 3. Quality and Security Recommendations

- The function currently doesn't use the passed MAC address in any way. Depending on the use case, consider incorporating it into the bootstrap script for device-specific configuration.
   
- Take care to sanitize any user-provided values such as MAC addresses to prevent injection attacks.
   
- The output of the `cat` command isn't currently captured or directed in any way. Consider redirecting it to a file or capturing it in a variable for later use.
   
- Document the expected bootstrap procedures in the function's comments, so that it's clear to users and maintainers what this script is expected to do.
   
- Finally, ensure that the function's usage is limited to users with appropriate permissions. The creation of a bootstrapping script should typically be restricted to system administrators or roles with equivalent privileges.
