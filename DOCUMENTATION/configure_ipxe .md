## `configure_ipxe `

Contained in `lib/functions.d/configure_ipxe.sh`

### Function overview

The `configure_ipxe` function is used to create a boot configuration file for [iPXE](https://ipxe.org/), an open-source network boot firmware. The configuration file is written to a specific directory, which is designated by the `HPS_MENU_CONFIG_DIR` global variable. The function also uses the `DHCP_IP` global variable to specify the server IP address within the configuration file. It creates a variety of boot options and procedures within the configuration file, enabling the iPXE server to provide network boot services.

### Technical description

- **Name:** configure_ipxe
- **Description:** The function creates a configuration file for a network boot firmware, iPXE. It sets up the file to respond to different conditions and boot options based on the client IP and MAC addresses.
- **Globals:** [ HPS_MENU_CONFIG_DIR: A global variable indicating the directory where the configuration file should be written. DHCP_IP: A global variable containing the IP address of the DHCP server.]
- **Arguments:** [ None ]
- **Outputs:** The function writes to a boot.ipxe configuration file in the specified directory.
- **Returns:** No value returned. The success of the function can be determined by the existence and correctness of the output file.
- **Example usage:** `configure_ipxe`

### Quality and security recommendations

- **Validate user input:** Make sure that all user input, such as the `HPS_MENU_CONFIG_DIR` and `DHCP_IP` global variables, are validated before use.
- **Use secure file permissions:** Ensure that the resulting configuration file has appropriate file permissions to prevent unauthorized access or modification.
- **Error Handling:** Add error handling to catch and handle potential errors or exceptions. For example, ensure that the directory exists before trying to write the file.
- **Code comments:** Improve code readability and maintainability by adding comments that describe the purpose and function of the code blocks.
- **Encryption or obfuscation:** If sensitive data is transmitted, consider using encryption or obfuscation to protect this data.
- **Regularly update software:** Regularly update iPXE and related software packages to ensure they have the latest security patches.
