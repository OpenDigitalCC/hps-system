### Quality and Security Recommendations

- To improve the quality, consider adding error handling mechanisms, for instance, in cases where the `cgi_header_plain` function fails.
- Be mindful of [shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) warnings. This tool helps in identifying and fixing potential bugs in the script.
- The current function does not take any arguments. However, if the function's complexity increases in future requiring it to accept user inputs, sanitize any user inputs to prevent possible Injection attacks.
- Avoid clear-text transmission of sensitive data and opt for HTTPS instead of HTTP for the `CGI_URL` if feasible.
- Consider implementing a logging mechanism that would log any potential run-time errors. This may prove useful for troubleshooting.
