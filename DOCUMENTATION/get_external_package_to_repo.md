### Quality and Security Recommendations
1.   Implement validation to ensure that the URL is a HTTPS URL to provide an added layer of security. 
2.   Implement checksum validation to ensure the integrity of the downloaded file. 
3.   Implement user permissions restrictions for the target repository directory to ensure that unauthorized users cannot modify or delete any downloaded files. 
4.   Add more descriptive error messages to guide a user in troubleshooting.
5.   Consider adding a check for free disk space before attempting download.
6.   Add verification logic to ensure that the downloaded file doesn't already exist in the repository.
7.   Implement a progress tracker to provide user feedback during large file downloads.
8.   Add proper logging mechanism for accurate troubleshooting and record keeping.
