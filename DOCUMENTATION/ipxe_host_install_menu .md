### Quality and security recommendations
1. To improve security, consider validating the value of `${mac:hexraw}` and `${selection}` variables before using them in the command to prevent possible command injection.
2. User inputs should be handled carefully. Ensure that the user can only choose pre-specified options and cannot input arbitrary values.
3. Include comments within your function to better explain the purpose and functionality of different parts of your code.
4. Consider error handling for the case when the user doesnâ€™t select any menu item.
5. It would be more maintainable to have a dynamic way to add or remove installation options.
6. Consider making sure that `ipxe_header` function (that is being called) exists and works as expected.
7. You may want to check and verify any external dependencies such as `imgfetch`, `chain`, and `CGI_URL`.
