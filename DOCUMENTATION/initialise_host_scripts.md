## `initialise_host_scripts`

Contained in `lib/functions.d/configure-distro.sh`

### Function overview

The `initialise_host_scripts` function is part of a broader bash script in a system deployment context. This function interacts with a remote server to retrieve a set of functions. Its main actions include initializing the host and fetching the provisioned bundle of bash functions from a remote server, which gets executed locally. If the function encounters any problem during fetching, it notifies the user.

### Technical description

- **Name**: initialise_host_scripts
- **Description**: This function aims to automatically initialize the host by fetching a set of shell scripts from a remote server, where these scripts contain bash functions. Once retrieved, these scripts are sourced into the currently running shell.
- **Globals**: None
- **Arguments**: None
- **Outputs**: This function outputs several messages in stdout or stderr about the progress of fetch operation.
- **Returns**: 0 when fetch is successful and the scripts were sourced correctly, 1 when the fetch operation fails.
- **Example Usage**: `initialise_host_scripts`

### Quality and security recommendations

- To enhance security, consider using HTTPS instead of HTTP in the URL to fetch the script. HTTPS ensures the encryption of the data during transmission.
- User input validation and error handling could be enhanced to prevent the function from failing silently in case of unexpected input or behavior.
- Sourcing a script from a remote location can be a huge security risk. Malicious code could potentially be included and executed. If not strictly necessary, consider alternative options.
- Use a more robust approach for string concatenation and variable expansion to avoid an unexpected result, such as array syntax. 
- Redirecting output errors to a log file will simplify the process of identifying and solving any future problems.
