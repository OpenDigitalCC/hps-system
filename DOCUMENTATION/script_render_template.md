Contained in `lib/functions.d/kickstart-functions.sh`

### Function Overview

The `script_render_template` is a bash function that iterates through all defined environment variables and then evaluates its values by replacing the placeholders present within the template. The placeholders are in the format `@...@` and their respective values would be `${...}`. This handy script allows dynamic content injection into predefined templates through environment variables.

### Technical Description
Following is the technical description of the function `script_render_template()`:

- **Name:** script_render_template()
- **Description:** Parses a template, replacing placeholders with corresponding environment variable values.
- **Globals:** No global variables being used.
- **Arguments:** No function level arguments are being passed.
- **Outputs:** The template text with all placeholders replaced with corresponding environment variable values.
- **Returns:** This function does not have return statements.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```bash
  VAR1="Hello"
  VAR2="World"
  echo "@VAR1@, @VAR2@!" | script_render_template
  # Output: Hello, World!
  ```

### Quality and Security Recommendations
- Validate the variable values before replacing in the template to ensure they do not contain malicious code.
- Handle the cases when an environment variable is not defined gracefully. Currently, it simply replaces with empty string.
- Introduce error handling or exceptions for potential `awk` failures.
- Secure the script from potential injection vulnerabilities.
- Try to document each segment of the code for better maintainability and understanding.
- Include a way to escape '@' for cases when we do not want replacement.
- Test this script with different use-cases and validate the integrity and security.
