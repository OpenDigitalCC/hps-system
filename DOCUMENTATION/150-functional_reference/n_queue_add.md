### Function Overview
The `n_queue_add()` function is designed to add a function call to the specified queue file. The function call is passed in as a variable from the command line. First, the function checks to see if a function was specified. If not, it outputs an error message and returns 1. It then attempts to add this call to the queue file. If successful, it outputs a confirmation message and returns 0. If unsuccessful, it outputs an error message and also returns 1.

### Technical Description
- Name: `n_queue_add()`
- Description: A function that adds a function call to a queue file.
- Globals: `N_QUEUE_FILE`: the file to which the queue will be written.
- Arguments: 
   - `$*`: All arguments passed from the command line, used as the function call add to the queue file.
- Outputs: 
   - Error message if no function is specified or if adding to the queue fails.
   - Confirmation message depicting the function call that has been queued.
- Returns:
   - 1: If it encounters an error (either no function specified or fails to add to the queue)
   - 0: If the function call is successfully added to the queue
- Example usage: `n_queue_add func_call`

### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. Validate the input to ensure it's a properly formatted function call.
2. Check for proper permissions before attempting to write to the queue file.
3. Handle exceptions for file operations, instead of the basic bash error output which might reveal system information.
4. Internal variables like `func_call` should be declared as local variables to avoid overwriting potential global variables with the same name.
5. For better readability, separate the error-checking process from the file-writing process.
6. Implement logs for both successful queueing and errors for backtracking issues.
7. Input sanitization should be performed to avoid Command Injection vulnerabilities.
