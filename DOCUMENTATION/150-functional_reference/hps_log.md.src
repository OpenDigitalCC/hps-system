### Function Overview
This bash function, `hps_log()`, is a logging mechanism in the Bash script dedicated to logging events from a particular system. Through this function, messages with different levels can be logged in a well-structured format including timestamp, identifier and log level into a system log file. The log identifier `ident`, the log file directory `HPS_LOG_DIR`, and the log level are adjusted through global variables and arguments.

### Technical Description
**name**: `hps_log`

**description**: A bash function for logging events in a system. It logs events into a system log file with the log format of timestamp, identifier, log level, and message.

**globals**: 
- `HPS_LOG_IDENT`: Used to set the identifier in the log. If not defined, defaults to 'hps'.
- `HPS_LOG_DIR`: Used to set the directory where the log file will be saved. Defaults must be set externally.

**arguments**: 
- `$1`: Represents the log level for the event. It's converted to uppercase.
- `$*`: Represents the message for the log that captures the system event details.

**outputs**: 
Writes a log entry to the `hps-system.log` file located at the log file directory `HPS_LOG_DIR`.

**returns**: 
Does not return a value but exits the function after writing the log entry.

**example usage**:

```bash
HPS_LOG_DIR="/path/to/log/directory"
hps_log "info" "System operation successful."
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. It's crucial to ensure the write permission for `HPS_LOG_DIR` directory to avoid permission denied error.
2. Sanitize user-supplied input to the function. Any user-supplied input incorporated into the log message should be properly sanitized to prevent code injection attacks and log forgery.
3. Implement log rotation and archival strategy. If the logging function is not properly managed, the log file could grow very large which could create a Denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the file system.
4. Add error handling to the logging function, to gracefully handle any errors occurred during logging, such as file write errors. 
5. Consider time synchronization and timezone information since log files often serve as a key piece of evidence during incident response and digital forensics.
