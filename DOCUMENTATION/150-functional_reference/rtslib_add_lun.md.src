### Function Overview

The function `rtslib_add_lun()` is a bash script function that interacts with a Python script. It adds a Logical Unit (LUN) to a specific target in the `rtslib-fb` Python module. A LUN is a logical reference to a portion of a storage subsystem. This function is used in the configuration of iSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface) targets, which allows the sharing of storage resources over a network.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `rtslib_add_lun`
- **Description:** This function adds a Logical Unit (LUN) to an iSCSI target in the `rtslib-fb` Python module using a Python script. The Python script checks to see if the target exists by comparing `iqn`s. If the target is discovered, the LUN is appended to the list of that target's LUNs.
- **Globals:** [] There are no global variables.
- **Arguments:** 
  - `$1: remote_host`, it is the name of the remote host.
  - `$2: zvol_path`, refers to the path to the zvol (ZFS volume).
- **Outputs:** If the target is not found, the script will print "‚ùå Target not found".
- **Returns:** The function doesn't directly return anything since it is used to manipulate state in the Python `rtslib-fb` module rather than produce output within the bash script. However, a side effect is that the Python script will cause an exit with status 1 when the target is not found. 
- **Example Usage:** `rtslib_add_lun "remotehost" "/path/to/zvol"`

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. The function could benefit from more sophisticated error handling. For instance, adding more explicit checks for whether the command-line arguments `$1` (`remote_host`) and `$2` (`zvol_path`) were provided.

2. This function relies heavily on Python script, it is recommended to preserve dependencies and ensure that the used python modules are kept up-to-date for the overall system's security.

3. It would be prudent to add validation to ensure that the `zvol_path` provided as an argument leads to a real and accessible path.

4. For better security, the function should handle cases where there are multiple iSCSI targets with the same iqn. This could involve updating the process to accept an additional parameter to uniquely identify targets.
