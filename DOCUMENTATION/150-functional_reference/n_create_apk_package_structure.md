### Function overview

The `n_create_apk_package_structure` function in Bash is designed for creating a structure for an APK package. This function works by first checking the required environment variables to determine the OpenSVC version and build directory. The version is then transformed following the Alpine format. It then verifies if the build directory exists and if the binaries are available within it. If these condition are met, it then detects the Alpine version before creating the basic directories for the APK package structure.

### Quality and security recommendations

1. For improved security, consider using more precise error handling instead of a general return 1 statement for different types of errors.
2. Always ensure that your environment variables are secured and not easily accessible which could pose a security risk.
3. Check permissions on directories and files to ensure only authorized users can access the data.
4. Consider adding more comments to increase code readability and maintainability in the long term.
5. Include checks or validations to ensure the version strings are valid.
