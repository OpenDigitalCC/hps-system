### Quality and Security recommendations

1. For security reasons, always ensure that the source from which you're sourcing your file is reliable and secure. In this case, make sure the `get_active_cluster_filename` function is returning a secure and correct path.
2. Since the path `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR` is used, make sure that it's defined before function execution and has the right permissions.
3. Always validate and sanitize inputs to your function, even if it does not accept any arguments, the global `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR` can be an input.
4. It's advisable to always use absolute paths and not relative paths as they can be navigated elsewhere.
5. In the NGINX configuration file, always ensure that worker connections are set optimally to prevent any Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
