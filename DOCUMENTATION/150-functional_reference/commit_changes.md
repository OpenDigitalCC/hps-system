### Function Overview

`commit_changes()` is a Bash function designed to process and commit configuration changes for a specified cluster. If a cluster cannot be found or there are no pending configuration changes, the function will log error or informative messages accordingly and exit. If pending configuration exists, each is processed. If any configuration item fails to be set, an error is logged and the function returns 1, indicating an error. After successful processing of all configurations, the pending configuration array is cleared, the DNS and DHCP file updates are triggered, a successful configuration change message is written to the log, and the function returns 0, indicating success.

### Technical Description

- **Name**: `commit_changes`
- **Description**: A  function to process and commit configuration changes for a specified cluster. Logs messages to indicate the function's status and result.
- **Globals**: 
  - `CLUSTER_NAME`: The name of the cluster where the changes will be committed. If not available, an error is thrown and the function returns 1.
  - `CLUSTER_CONFIG_PENDING`: An array storing the configurations to be committed. If empty, a message is logged and the function returns 0.
- **Arguments**: None
- **Outputs**: Logs various messages to indicate the status and result of the commit operation.
- **Returns**: 
  - Returns 1 if the cluster name is not available or if setting the new configuration fails.
  - Returns 0 if there are no configuration changes to commit or if the configurations are successfully committed.
- **Example Usage**: 
```bash
commit_changes
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Validate the format and integrity of configuration inputs before processing. This can prevent unexpected behaviour or security issues.
2. Consider adding a dry-run mode where the changes that would be made can be previewed before they are committed.
3. Since this function heavily relies on global variables, consider making it more self-contained by taking both the cluster name and configuration pending as arguments.
4. Enforce proper error handling and logging for each function call and possible failure scenarios.
5. Conduct regular code audits to maintain the function's security and performance.
