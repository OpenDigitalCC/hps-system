### Function overview

This function, `cluster_has_installed_sch()`, checks a directory containing configuration files by reading and processing each file one at a time. Specifically, it checks for the presence of files ending with `.conf` extension. Within each file, it reads key-value lines and processes the lines containing "TYPE" and "STATE". It then checks if `type` is "SCH" and `state` is "INSTALLED". If it finds a match, it returns 0, indicating success. If no match is found after reading all the files, it returns 1, indicating failure.

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure `HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR` is set and is a valid directory.
2. Provide a graceful exit or report an error message if the configuration directory does not exist.
3. Consider using stricter checks when processing each file's content. This can help prevent potential issues related to unexpected data.
4. Add more comments throughout the script to explain the function of each part.
5. In terms of security, be aware of potential "Path Traversal" vulnerabilities if the directory contains symbolic links pointing outside of the intended directory tree. You might want to add a check to ensure symbolic links are not processed.
