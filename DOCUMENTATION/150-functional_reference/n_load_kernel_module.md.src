Function signature: e8d3e185dcbaf9a04014e264ef088ba7b3adf4b74b818ea01d0f4f6ddc3c93d9

### Function Overview

The `n_load_kernel_module` function is designed to handle the loading of a specified module within the Linux operating system kernel. The primary function is to check whether a specified module is already loaded, and, if necessary, load it into the system. Errors are managed and reported on an ongoing basis, allowing the script to respond to various issues such as unmounted modloops and undetectable kernel versions.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `n_load_kernel_module` 
- **Description:** This function attempts to load a specified Linux kernel module by verifying if it's already loaded, confirming modloop is mounted, detecting the kernel version, finding the module file, and lastly, loading the module.
- **Globals:** None
- **Arguments:** 
  - `$1: module_name` - The name of a Linux kernel module that will be attempted to load.
- **Outputs:** Log messages about process stages and any errors encountered.
- **Returns:** 
  - `0` if the module is successfully loaded or is already loaded.
  - `1` if the modloop isnâ€™t mounted or the module directory is not found.
  - `2` if the module itself isn't found.
  - `3` if there is failure in loading the module.
- **Example Usage:** `n_load_kernel_module driver_name`

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Implement more robust error checking and handling mechanisms for the edge cases not currently managed by the function.
2. Avoid directly echoing errors to STDERR. Instead, make use of dedicated logging functions or systems to register error logs.
3. Develop code to verify kernel module names, this will make the component more robust against malicious input or any textual mistakes.
4. Avoid using commands that could potentially expose the system to command injection attacks.
5. If the function will run with administrative or superuser permissions, extra caution should be taken to ensure that input is properly sanitized.
