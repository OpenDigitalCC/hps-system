### Function Overview

The function `build_dns_hosts_file()` is tasked with constructing a DNS hosts file. It first defines the working paths and logs the action it's about to execute. Then, the function does a check and creates a services directory if it's not already there. 

The function then retrieves the DNS domain and the IPS IP address from the cluster configuration. These values are then validated, and possible errors are logged. Then, aliases for the IPS service are defined.

Afterwards, it starts with an empty temporary file and begins to add entries, keeping count of each one. Finally, the function attempts to move the temporary file to the intended location. Should this fail, the temporary file is deleted and an error logged. If successful, an information log is created outlining how many entries were made.

### Technical Description

- **Globals:** None
- **Arguments:** None
- **Outputs:** Logs various messages depending on the steps. These could be successful steps or errors during executing the function.
- **Returns:** 1 when there is an error (like failing to create directory or get DNS domain, failing to get or validate IPS IP, or failing to write DNS hosts file), 0 on successful function execution.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Error Handling: Increase the robustness of the function by adding more nuanced error-handling, perhaps with specific error codes or messages depending on the point of failure.
2. Check for Dependencies: At the start of the function, check whether all necessary dependencies (such as dnsmasq or other commands used) are available on the system.
3. Logging: Consider enhancing logging to record more detailed information about the function’s operation, which could be useful for auditing or troubleshooting purposes.
4. Security Hardening: Be sure to carefully validate and sanitize all inputs to the function to guard against injection attacks or other forms of malicious input.
5: Consider implementing a safe-guard or confirmation prompt before creating directories or files on the user’s system.
