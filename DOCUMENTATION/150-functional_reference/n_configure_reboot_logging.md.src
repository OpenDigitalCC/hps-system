Function signature: 45a474d37372ed7aa71a115b4704b2d7d54b24bf67d31b58d4662839f38a4494

### Function Overview
The function `n_configure_reboot_logging()` is designed to enable and configure reboot logging on a system. It performs a series of operations to ensure that any system reboots, power-offs, halts, or shutdown commands are properly logged both locally and remotely (if available).

The function first checks if Bash is present in the system as it is required for logging. If Bash is not found, an error is logged and the function returns immediately.

The function then ensures that the `/usr/local/sbin` directory exists where it will create wrapper scripts for `reboot`, `poweroff`, `halt` commands. These scripts are designed to log each command execution. It also handles the `shutdown` command if it exists.

Lastly, it makes sure that `/usr/local/sbin` is the first directory in the `PATH` environment variable and establishes a shutdown hook for additional logging.

### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. Always check if the directory/file exists before performing operations on it.
2. The function should handle or log errors during the script creation, permission change operations, and not just ignore them silently.
3. Check if the required commands exist on the machine before trying to execute them to prevent runtime errors.
4. Make sure that sensitive information is not being revealed in the logs.
5. Consider using more secure methods to change the `PATH`.
6. Ensure permissions are safe for created scripts and configuration files.
