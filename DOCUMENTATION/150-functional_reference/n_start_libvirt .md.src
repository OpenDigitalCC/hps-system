### Function overview

The function `n_start_libvirt` is a Bash function designed to start up the libvirtd and virtlogd services. These services are foundational pieces for managing platform virtualization, enabling the user to interact with virtualization capabilities of the system's kernel.

### Technical description

- **Name:** n_start_libvirt
- **Description:** A Bash function that starts the libvirtd and virtlogd services using the `rc-service` command.
- **Globals:** None
- **Arguments:** None
- **Outputs:** Outputs the results of the `rc-service` command, providing status information on the starting process of the services.
- **Returns:** Returns the exit code of the last `rc-service` command executed, giving an indication if services started correctly (typical return codes: 0 for success, non-zero for failure).
- **Example usage:** `n_start_libvirt` - this will attempt to start the libvirtd and virtlogd services.

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Check whether the `rc-service` command exists and is executable before calling it to ensure that the function won't fail because of the missing required command.
2. Verify whether the services are already running before attempting to start them. This could prevent unnecessary errors and give a clearer understanding of the function's activities.
3. Implement logging for the starting process of services. It would be useful for debugging and auditing.
4. In case of running this function with higher privileges, make sure it cannot be exploited or invoked unintentionally, causing potential security risks.
5. Consider adding error handling to capture and manage any possible start-up errors of services.
