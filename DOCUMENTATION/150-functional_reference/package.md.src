### Function Overview

The `package` function in shell scripting is a simple function that is utilized for creating a new directory (if it doesn't already exist) and copying files. It mainly involves two operations: directory creation and file reproduction. The function first checks for the existence of a specific directory referenced by the variable `pkgdir`. If the directory does not exist, one will be created. Then, it copies all files and directories contained within `usr` directory of `startdir` to the newly created `pkgdir`.

### Technical Description

- **name**: `package`
- **description**: This function intelligently creates a directory, if it doesn't already exist, referenced by the variable `pkgdir`. Subsequently, it duplicates the files and directories present in `usr` directory of `startdir` to `pkgdir`.
- **globals**: [ `pkgdir`: The path to the directory where the contents of `usr` will be copied, `startdir`: The origin directory where `usr` is located]
- **arguments**: [ None ]
- **outputs**: Duplicates the contents of `startdir/usr` inside `pkgdir`.
- **returns**: None
- **example usage**: 
```
startdir="/path/to/startdir"
pkgdir="/path/to/pkgdir"
package
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Proper validation should be applied to the variables `pkgdir` and `startdir` to ensure they are valid directories.
2. Permissions checks should be implemented. The script should ensure that it has the necessary write permissions to the `pkgdir` and read permissions to the `startdir`.
3. Error handling should be improved. Make sure to check for potential errors from `mkdir` and `cp` commands, and take the necessary actions when they do occur.
4. Implement more robust logging for easier troubleshooting. Currently, itâ€™s not logged when the function starts, succeeds, or fails; this can make debugging more difficult.
5. Always use double quotes around variable references to avoid globbing and word splitting, when necessary.
