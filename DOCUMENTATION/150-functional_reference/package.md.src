Function signature: e4ac394e47db157e04fecc2f4b78c7140347675a65a982269bafad18d69af063

### Function Overview

This function essentially creates a new directory with the name given by the variable `$pkgdir`. If the directory already exists, the function does nothing. Afterwards, it recursively copies everything from the `/usr` directory of `$startdir` into the newly created or existing `$pkgdir`.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `package()`
- **Description:** This function is used to create a new directory (if it doesn't already exist) from the `$pkgdir` variable. Then, it copies everything, including all files and subdirectories, from the `/usr` directory of `$startdir` into the newly created `$pkgdir`.
- **Globals:** [`$pkgdir`: Directory to be created or already exists, `$startdir`: Source directory from where the contents of `/usr` will be copied.]
- **Arguments:** This function does not take any arguments.
- **Outputs:** The output is a new directory (if initially non-existent) named as per `$pkgdir` at the current path and copies of all the contents of `/usr` of `$startdir` into `$pkgdir`.
- **Returns:** Does not return anything.
- **Example Usage:**
   ```
   startdir="/path/to/startdir"
   pkgdir="package"
   package
   ```
This will create a new directory `package` in the current directory and copy all contents from `/path/to/startdir/usr` into `package/`.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Validate input parameters: Always check to ensure that the global variables `$pkgdir` and `$startdir` are not empty or invalid.
2. Avoid overwriting existing files: Add checks to ensure that the current contents of `$pkgdir` directory (if it exists) also should not be overwritten without explicit intention.
3. Use absolute paths: To avoid any confusion around which directories are being used, consider using absolute paths instead of relative ones.
4. Error Checking: Implement appropriate error checking to handle failures from `mkdir` and `cp`. The function should not assume that these commands will always succeed.
5. Use secure copy tools: Consider using secure alternatives to `cp` if copying sensitive data. This could prevent leaking sensitive metadata.
