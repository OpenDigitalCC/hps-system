Function signature: e4ac394e47db157e04fecc2f4b78c7140347675a65a982269bafad18d69af063

### Function Overview

The `package` function in the bash script creates a directory named `pkgdir`, if it doesn't exist, and copies the contents of `usr` directory from `startdir` into `pkgdir`. This function can be useful in packaging files for application releases, software installation, or transfers.

### Technical Description

**Name**: package

**Description**: This bash function creates a "pkgdir" directory and copies the contents from the "usr" directory of "startdir" to the newly formed "pkgdir".

**Globals**: [$pkgdir: A string that represents the name/path of the target directory, $startdir: A string that specifies the source directory containing a 'usr' directory, which will be copied]

**Arguments**: [None. This function does not take any arguments]

**Outputs**: If successful, it will create a directory and copy files but will not provide any explicit output. In case of an error, the standard error may be output by the commands used in the function (mkdir, cp).

**Returns**: The function does not explicitly return any value. Indirectly, it returns zero when the function executes successfully, else the error code correlating to the error that occurred.

**Example Usage**: Assume that `startdir` and `pkgdir` are already set in the script; we would call the function as follows: `package`

### Quality And Security Recommendations

1. Implement a failsafe check to verify if "startdir"/usr exists before `cp` command and "pkgdir" after `mkdir -p` command.
2. Add error handling routines to catch possible failures from mkdir and cp and provide meaningful error messages instead of the system errors.
3. Make sure that there are no permissions issues with "startdir"/usr and "pkgdir". Consider checking and setting appropriate permissions as required.
4. Validate all external variables like "startdir" and "pkgdir" before use.
5. Opt for verbosity `-v` flag with cp and mkdir for easier debugging and logging.
