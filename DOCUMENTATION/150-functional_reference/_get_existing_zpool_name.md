Function signature: cc41e1bc5b39a7a3e09eef4edc9166c5f5783d182d1cd860936367173015ae84

### Function Overview

This function, `_get_existing_zpool_name`, is used for obtaining the existing ZFS pool name from a remote host. If the ZFS pool name is present, the script prints the name to stdout and returns a zero exit status. If the ZFS pool name is not found, the function returns a non-zero exit status. 

The code processes options (e.g. `strategy`, `mountpoint`, `force`, `dry-run`, `no-defaults`) and calls helper functions like `zpool_name_generate` and `zfs_get_defaults` for specific functionalities. It also checks the ZPOOL_NAME before proceeding, validates the policy rules, generates the pool name and selects a disk based on the strategy. 

Subsequently, the script performs the creation of the pool, persists the host variable ZPOOL_NAME and provides appropriate logging and error handling throughout the execution.

### Technical Description

- Function name: `_get_existing_zpool_name`
- Description: This function is responsible for obtaining the name of an existing ZFS pool from a remote host.
- Globals:
  - `ZPOOL_NAME`: The name of the ZFS storage pool.
- Arguments: 
  - `$1`: Command line arguments and options.
  - `$2`: Value of argument where it applies.
- Output: Prints the ZFS storage pool name to stdout if exists.
- Returns: Exit status `0` when pool name is found, `1` or `2` when there is an error.
- Example Usage: `_get_existing_zpool_name --strategy first --mountpoint /tmp --dry-run`

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. The function could benefit from additional input validation. Checking whether the provided arguments are recognizable before their first usage could prevent unexpected behaviors.
2. The error messages can be improved to be more descriptive. For example, stating precisely why a specific helper function is missing could allow an easier troubleshooting experience.
3. The function relies heavily on other functions (helpers), their availability and their output. As such, this function could be prone to break if any of the helper functions are modified. Robust integration tests could help catch these issues.
4. Security-wise, the script does not seem to sanitize inputs when making system calls. This could potentially lead to command injection vulnerabilities. Performing rigorous input validation and sanitization throughout the script would help mitigate this risk.
5. Consider implementing a more comprehensive logging functionality, such as logging every action and result, which can help in debugging and can be crucial in live environments.
6. If possible, make the function idempotent. The function should give the same output and have the same side effects, regardless of how many times it's run with the same inputs. This would ensure predictable behavior.
