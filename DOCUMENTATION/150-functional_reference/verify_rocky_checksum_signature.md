### Function overview

The `verify_rocky_checksum_signature` is a Bash function designed for verifying the checksum signature of a specified Rocky Linux ISO image. It accomplishes this by first downloading the checksum and signature associated with the provided version of the Rocky Linux ISO image, then importing the GPG key from the Rocky Linux server, and finally, verifying the GPG signature. If all passes, the function will then calculate and compare the sha256 checksum of a specified ISO file to ensure the ISO image has not been tampered with.

### Technical description

- Name: `verify_rocky_checksum_signature`
- Description: This function downloads and verifies the checksum and its signature of a Rocky Linux ISO image. Additionally, it validates the SHA256 hash of the ISO file against the downloaded checksum.
- Globals: 
  - `HPS_DISTROS_DIR`: A directory path where Rocky Linux distribution files are stored.
- Arguments: 
  - `$1 (version)`: The version of Rocky Linux ISO image to verify.
- Outputs: The function will output various status messages indicating the status of download, GPG key import, and verification steps.
- Returns: 
  - `0`: Success. The checksum signature has been verified and matches the checksum of the specified ISO image.
  - `1`: Failure. The GPG key import process was unsuccessful.
  - `2`: Failure. The checksum signature verification failed.
  - `3`: Failure. No checksum was found for the specified ISO image.
  - `4`: Failure. The checksum of the ISO file does not match the downloaded checksum.
- Example Usage:
  - `verify_rocky_checksum_signature "8.4"`

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Always ensure to use secure and up-to-date versions of all tools and packages used in the function.
2. Instead of hardcoding the architecture (`x86_64`), consider making it an argument or an environment variable that is configurable by the user.
3. Consider checking whether the `curl` and `gpg` commands succeed immediately rather than using a mixture of exit status checks and error redirections.
4. Employ better error handling and provide more specific output messages in case of failures.
5. Avoid reassigning constants in the middle of the function, such as `checksum_path` and `sig_path`.
6. Uncomment the downloading commands for CHECKSUM and CHECKSUM.sig or explain why they are commented out.
