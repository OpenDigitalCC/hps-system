### Quality and security recommendations

1. Add logging for monitoring purposes: It's better to add a logging utility for debugging and maintenance. Specific events to log could include successful configuration, error during configuration, status pre-configuration and post-configuration.
2. Parameterize the function: If the configurations vary by OpenSVC cluster, it may make more sense to parameterize the function.
3. Error handling: Any failure in the `hps_configure_opensvc_cluster` function could lead to the OpenSVC cluster being unconfigured, potentially leading to errors downstream. Therefore, error handling is crucial in this function.
4. Function documentation: Be sure to document what exactly `hps_configure_opensvc_cluster` is doing, what configurations/settings are being changed, and any potential side effects.
5. Security: If configuring OpenSVC requires credentials, ensure those are not being hardcoded in the script and are stored safely. In addition, ensure that any necessary access control is implemented.
