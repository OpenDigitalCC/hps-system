### Function Overview

The function `zfs_get_defaults` is designed for setting sensible defaults for pool options (`_POOL_OPTS`) and ZFS properties (`_ZFS_PROPS`). This function helps to customize and optimize your ZFS filesystem according to your needs. Pool options include sector size, while ZFS properties cover settings such as compression type, access time, extended attribute style, Access Control List (ACL) type, mode, inheritance, node size, and log bias.

### Technical Description

- Name: `zfs_get_defaults`
- Description: This function sets default values for pool options (`_POOL_OPTS`) and ZFS properties (`_ZFS_PROPS`). The pool options are safest for SSD/NVMe/HDD with 4K-sectors. The ZFS properties include features like compression, access time, ACLs, and others.
- Globals: 
  - `_POOL_OPTS`: An array to store pool options.
  - `_ZFS_PROPS`: An array to store ZFS properties.
- Arguments: 
  - `$1`: A reference to a variable intended to hold pool options.
  - `$2`: A reference to a variable intended to hold ZFS properties.
- Outputs: There are no explicit outputs besides the modified `_POOL_OPTS` and `_ZFS_PROPS` variables.
- Returns: This function does not have any explicit return values and does not generate exit status.
- Example usage: `zfs_get_defaults POOL_OPTS ZFS_PROPS`

### Quality And Security Recommendations

1. Consider making the function's name more descriptive, such as `set_zfs_defaults`, to specify the action that the function performs.
2. For improved security, validate the variables that are passed into the function to ensure they allow item assignment.
3. When setting sensible defaults, remember to base it on the actual use case scenario and the nature of the data handled.
4. To enhance transparency and ease of debugging, consider implementing a logging system to record any changes made by the function.
5. The comments flagged with 'TODO' should be addressed. Consider implementing the -O props within the function as these can provide an additional level of customization for the user.
6. Always include error checking in your functions to catch unexpected scenarios and improve robustness.
