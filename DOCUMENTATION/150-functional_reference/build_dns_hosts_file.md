### Function overview

The `build_dns_hosts_file` function in Bash is essentially a method that configures the details required for a DNS hosts file in a cluster. The function works by setting the specific directories and files, logging the process, analysing cluster configurations for domain name and IP address, validating the given IP, defining IPS service aliases, starting with an empty temporary file, and writing these entries into the file. It then moves this temporary file to the destined location. If any step fails, it logs an error and returns from the function. 

### Technical description

- **Name:** build_dns_hosts_file
- **Description:** The function `build_dns_hosts_file` sets up a DNS hosts file in a cluster. It first sets directories and goes on to fetch important details like DNS domain and IP address from the cluster configuration. It validates the received IP and then constructs the DNS hosts file. If any step fails, it logs the error message and returns from the function.
- **Globals:** [ HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_DIR: An environmental variable defining the directory path of the cluster services ]
- **Arguments:** [ None: This function doesn't require any arguments ]
- **Outputs:** This function writes entries into a temporary file and then moves this file to the final location. If any error occurs during the process, it logs the error message.
- **Returns:** The function will return '1' if the process fails at any step, and '0' if the function is executed successfully. 
- **Example Usage:** 
```bash
build_dns_hosts_file
```
### Quality and security recommendations

1. Implement error message handling for each step, to avoid cascading failure effects.
2. Include input validation to the best extent possible.
3. Use security measures to protect IP and other sensitive details from being mishandled.
4. Workflow debugging might be needed to spot code imperfections to pre-empt errors.
5. Use file permissions correctly to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files and directories. The DNS hosts file should have appropriate restrictive permissions.
6. Protect the function and its processes from interruptions and ensure graceful exits in case of errors.
