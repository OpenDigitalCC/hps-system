### Function Overview

`keysafe_validate_token` is a function in Bash, designed to validate the token passed from keysafe. It validates the token against the expected purpose and also checks the token expiration. If the token is valid, it gets consumed and removed immediately. In case the provided token is invalid or expired or doesn't match the expected purpose, the function provides relevant error messages.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `keysafe_validate_token`
- **Description:** This function validates the keysafe token for its authenticity, expiration, and the purpose for which it was generated. It reads the token data from a file and deletes the file if the token is valid.
- **Globals:** None
- **Arguments:**
  - `$1` (token): The token passed to the function to be authenticated.
  - `$2` (expected_purpose): The expected value of the token purpose.
- **Outputs:** Error or warning messages.
- **Returns:** Returns error codes. (1: Keysafe directory failure, 2: Invalid or already consumed token, 3: Token expired, 4: Token purpose mismatch, 5: Token argument missing)
- **Example Usage:**

    ```bash
    keysafe_validate_token "$your_token" "your_expected_purpose"
    ```
  
### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Add error handling if the `source` command fails to read the token metadata.
2. Always validate user input. Ensure that both the token and purpose values are sanitized before they are processed in the function.
3. It's good practice to delete the used token immediately, as shown in this function. However, a failsafe mechanism should be in place if deleting the file fails.
4. In the interest of robustness, consider implementing logic to handle when `get_keysafe_dir` function fails to retrieve keysafe directory.
5. Always log error messages to help with troubleshooting. However, avoid logging sensitive data such as the actual token value.
