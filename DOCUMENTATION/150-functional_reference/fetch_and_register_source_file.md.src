### Function Overview 

The function `fetch_and_register_source_file()` is designed to first download a file from a specified url and then register this file using a given handler. The function accepts three arguments; the url from which the file will be downloaded, the handler which will be used to process the file after download and the filename of the downloaded file. If the filename is not provided, the function will take the base name from the url. 

### Technical Description 

- Name: `fetch_and_register_source_file`
- Description: This function is used to download a file from a given url and then register it using a provided handler.
- Globals: None.
- Arguments: 
  - $1: url from which the file will be downloaded.
  - $2: handler used to process the file after the download.
  - $3: filename of the downloaded file. If not provided, the function will derive it from the given url.
- Outputs: The function performs the task of downloading and registering a file. There are no specific output returns on the console.
