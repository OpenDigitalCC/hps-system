Contained in `lib/functions.d/keysafe_functions.sh`

Function signature: c84ad9d04dca1d7aa2bb79eee2302c774f89404291568bc324a376f3d3c8f37d

### Function Overview

The primary purpose of the `keysafe_handle_token_request` function is to manage and handle token requests. This function accepts a MAC address and a purpose as parameters. It validates these parameters and in case one of them is not provided, a warning message is logged and the function returns an error code. Then, the function fetches the node id by using the provided MAC address. If the node id couldn't be determined, the function sets it to "unknown" and continues its operation. The next step is issuing a token. If the token is issued successfully, it is returned by the function. Otherwise, an error message is logged and shown.

### Technical Description

- **name:** keysafe_handle_token_request
- **description:** This function manages token requests by validating inputs, handling exceptions and finally issuing a token.
- **globals:** [ mac: MAC address, purpose: The purpose for which the token is being requested ]
- **arguments:** [ $1: MAC address, $2: Purpose ]
- **outputs**: On successful completion, the function prints the issued token. On failure, it logs an error message and returns an error code. 
- **returns**: If function is successful, it returns 0. If MAC address or purpose is missing, it returns 1 or 2 respectively. If unable to issue the token, it returns 3.
- **example usage:** keysafe_handle_token_request "aabbccddeeff" "token_request"

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Implement input sanitation for the 'mac' and 'purpose' parameters to avoid potential command injection vulnerabilities.
2. Improve error handling by providing meaningful error messages for every return code.
3. Implement further checks to avoid issuing tokens to invalid MAC addresses or nodes.
4. The function might benefit from a restructure to reduce its complexity and improve the readability of the code.
5. It's recommended to employ debug logging at the start of the function execution to aid in troubleshooting potential issues.
