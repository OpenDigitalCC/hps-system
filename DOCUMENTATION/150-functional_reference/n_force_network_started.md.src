Contained in `lib/host-scripts.d/alpine.d/networking-functions.sh`

Function signature: 448c7f84e1898821d351326c82f995cb0da05d48164042795fd8f9ec14ea1b86

### Function overview

The function `n_force_network_started()` attempts to manually force the networking service of the system to appear as 'started'. It initially cleans any failed state of the service, then creates necessary state files, and marks the service as 'started'. It verifies the state of the service at the end and returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation was successful.

### Technical description

- **Name**: n_force_network_started
- **Description**: This function forces the networking service to appear 'started'. It creates necessary directories, files, and markers, and also double-checks the status of the service.
- **Globals**: None used in this function.
- **Arguments**: No arguments are used in this function.
- **Outputs**: The function outputs log messages indicating the progress of the operation, such as marking the service as started, verifying its status, and error messages if any failures occur.
- **Returns**: The function returns `0` if the networking service is successfully marked as started and verified; returns `1` if it fails to mark the networking service as started.
- **Example usage**: The function can be used like so: `n_force_network_started`. Since it doesn't take any arguments, it's invoked without any.

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Although the current function seems to handle errors by logging messages, it could be made more robust by including error exception handling.
2. All filesystem operations are potential points of failure, and should be checked for success/failure.
3. All external commands (such as `mkdir`, `touch`, `sed`, and `rc-status`) should have their return status checked.
4. It may be beneficial to split this function into multiple smaller functions, such as one for directory creation, one for file creation and modification, one for verification. This may increase readability and maintainability of the script.
5. Considering security, it is preferable to avoid the execution of shell commands wherever possible, as they can expose vulnerabilities. 
6. There's room for adding more comments explaining the individual steps, making it easier for others to understand the purpose of each command.
