Function signature: de21a4a364feb0c001016f8d48f06a318c8c14aa1115120e71e72b590755ee99

### Function Overview

This function, `_apkovl_create_structure`, is responsible for creating a directory structure for Alpine Linux overlay (apkovl). It takes one argument, `tmp_dir`, which specifies the temporary directory where the structure is to be created. The function attempts to create two directories namely, `etc/local.d` and `etc/runlevels/default` within `tmp_dir`. It also sets up a symlink for the local service at boot. Any failure in the creation of directories or symlink results in an error message and halts the execution of the script.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `_apkovl_create_structure`
- **Description:** This function creates a directory structure for apkovl at a specified temporary location. It tries to set up the local service to be enabled at boot.
- **Globals:** None.
- **Arguments:**
  - **$1 (tmp_dir):** The root directory where the apkovl structure is to be created.
- **Outputs:** Logs messages about operation status (debug and error).
- **Returns:**
  - **1:** If failed to create directories or local service symlink.
  - **0:** If execution completes without any error.
- **Example Usage:**
```bash
temp_directory="/tmp/my_directory"
_apkovl_create_structure $temp_directory
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Check if the argument input (tmp_dir) is not empty. This would prevent potential issues from attempting to create directories at the filesystem root.
2. Check if `tmp_dir` ends with a trailing slash and handle the scenario appropriately to prevent potential directory creation errors.
3. Consider using absolute paths for directory creation to prevent unexpected results due to relative paths.
4. Validate success of each operation, not just directory and symlink creations. This will improve error reporting and make troubleshooting easier in complex setups.
5. Make use of more secure and reliable logging mechanisms for output messages.
6. Employ appropriate file and folder permissions when creating the directories and setting up the symlink to avoid security risks.
