Function signature: 84093d24ed6e059f89dd6ad32c2ff11b16b0fd2540a9f3c88ab3932e8a93570b

### Function Overview

The `start_pre` function in bash script is primarily used to handle out of memory situations and ensure that the essential data directory exists. Initially, it checks whether the current bash process has write permissions on `/proc/self/oom_score_adj` file to protect the process from being terminated due to out of memory (OOM) conditions. Afterwards, it validates that the data directory `/var/lib/opensvc` exists or else creates it.

### Technical Description

**Name:** `start_pre`

**Description:** The function verifies if the existing process has the writing permission for the OOM score adjustment. If it does, it changes the value to -1000 therein, giving the process a lower likelihood of being killed during an OOM scenario. Following that, it checks for the existence of a directory, and if absent, it takes responsibility for creating it.

**Globals**: None

**Arguments**: None

**Outputs:** Writes `-1000` to `/proc/self/oom_score_adj` if it has write permissions. Creates `/var/lib/opensvc` directory if it doesn't already exist.

**Returns:** Nothing

**Example Usage:**

```bash
source script_name.sh
start_pre
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. It's highly recommended to add error handling for directory creation. If `mkdir` fails, it should notify the user.
2. The number `-1000` is hardcoded. It's advisable to make it a constant, with an understandable name, at the start of the script.
3. To further enhance security, consider modifying permissions of `/var/lib/opensvc` directory in the script, as per the use case requirements after creation.
4. Validate the impact of changing the OOM score beforehand, especially in production environments.
5. Log significant script actions and errors for debugging purposes.
