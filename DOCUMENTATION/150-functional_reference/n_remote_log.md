Function signature: 0f3f34eb844b248235362d1ec5c747e0d2e05f807738bdd13abc7927c1be4755

### Function overview

The provided function `n_remote_log()` is used to log messages remotely. The input parameters to the function are a message and the function from which `n_remote_log()` is called. The function ensures the correctness of the inputs and validates the successfully processing of the `n_ips_command`. In the scenario where `n_ips_command` fails, the function outputs error information to the stdout and returns the corresponding exit code. If the `n_ips_command` executes successfully, the function simply returns 0.

### Technical description

- **Name:** `n_remote_log`
- **Description:** This function logs messages to a remote server, taking in the message and the calling function as its arguments. It outputs errors to stdout and returns the exit code of the `n_ips_command` if it fails. If there is no failure, it returns 0.
- **Globals:** 
  - `N_IPS_COMMAND_LAST_ERROR`: This stores the last error message if the `n_ips_command` execution fails. 
  - `N_IPS_COMMAND_LAST_RESPONSE`: This stores the last response from the server if the `n_ips_command` execution fails.
- **Arguments:** 
  - `$1: message`: The message to be logged remotely. 
  - `$2: function`: The function that is calling `n_remote_log`.
- **Outputs:** Outputs error info to stdout if the `n_ips_command` fails.
- **Returns:** Returns the exit code of the `n_ips_command` in case of a failure, otherwise returns 0.
- **Example Usage:**
   ```bash
   n_remote_log "Test message" "Test function"
   ```
    
### Quality and security recommendations

1. The function should handle the condition when the `message` is empty or when the `function` is not provided.
2. For better error handling, there should be different exit codes for different error scenarios. The function currently only returns the exit code of `n_ips_command` or 0.
3. In case of an error response from the server, additional information such as timestamp, server name, and error code would be beneficial for debugging.
4. Error messages should be logged in a separate error log, instead of stdout, to keep the stdout clean and improve error management.
5. Proper input sanitization and validation must be implemented to prevent command injection or code execution attacks.
6. Confidential information or sensitive data, if part of logs, must be handled appropriately or hashed before logging.
