### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Always test this function with non-critical services before applying it to a live cluster to ensure its proper operation.
2. Guarantee that each of the invoked functions (like `configure_supervisor_services`, `create_supervisor_services_config`, `reload_supervisor_config`, `hps_log`, and `hps_services_post_start`) securely manage exceptions, errors and return statuses.
3. Ensure that logging is set at an appropriate verbosity level to provide enough detail for troubleshooting any issues that may arise without overcrowding the log files.
4. Validate user inputs or values loaded from files before utilizing them to prevent potential code injection attacks.
5. Make sure access permissions are correctly set, to prevent unauthorized access.
6. Always keep the HPS environment and the related software components updated, as new updates often bring security patches and enhanced performance.
