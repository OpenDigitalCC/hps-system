### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Error handling should be implemented to catch any potential issues during the execution of the associated functions. This will result in a more robust and fail-safe function.
2. Security check should be implemented before executing any operations, specifically before accessing or modifying any directory or file.
3. Variables should be properly sanitized and validated to protect from code injection.
4. Any potential race conditions should be addressed to prevent unexpected behavior.
