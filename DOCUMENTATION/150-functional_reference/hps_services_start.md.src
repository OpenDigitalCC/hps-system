### Function Overview

The `hps_services_start` function works within a Bash context to set up and start all the cluster services within a given set up. The function involves several steps. Initially, it calls the `configure_supervisor_services` function to set up the services. Subsequently, the `reload_supervisor_config` function is triggered to refresh the configuration setup. Then, the `supervisorctl` command is executed with a configuration file present in the directory path returned by `get_path_cluster_services_dir` function, to start all services. Finally, a `hps_services_post_start` function is called which can be utilized to perform post startup operations.

### Technical Description

- **Name**: `hps_services_start`
- **Description**: A function provided to set up and start all services in a cluster configuration. 
- **Globals**: None
- **Arguments**: None
- **Outputs**: This function does not explicitly output any values.
- **Returns**: This function does not have any return statement, meaning the shell's exit status is left at the result of the last command executed (which in this case is `hps_services_post_start`).
- **Example Usage**: This function is typically run within an environment that has the necessary variables and dependencies, and is simply called as `hps_services_start`.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Implement error handling: To enhance the function's reliability, error handling should be incorporated to manage the failures of the intermediate commands.
2. Insert debugging code: As a part of quality enhancements, it would be beneficial to include debugging code which could provide detailed insights into the function's operation when required.
3. Security improvements: If the function is used in a high security environment, it would be important to ensure that the permissions for the supervisor configuration files and the directories involved are restricted. 
4. Check for dependency issues: Effort should be made to test the function in an environment similar to the one in which it is supposed to run, to check for any unmet dependencies.
