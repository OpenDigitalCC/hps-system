### Function Overview

The `bootstrap_get_functions` function's main objective is to fetch and source bootstrap functions from a URL generated using a given gateway and distro parameter. The URL is generated with a gateway caught from the `bootstrap_get_provisioning_node` function and a distro string from `bootstrap_initialise_distro_string` function. Curl is then used to retrieve and source the bootstrap functions. The function echoes a success or failure message, indicating whether the bootstrap functions were successfully loaded or not.

### Technical Description

- **Name**: `bootstrap_get_functions`
- **Description**: This function fetches bootstrap functions from a specific server URL using curl, then sources them. The URL varies based upon the variables defined in the locally retrieved gateway and distro parameters.
- **Globals**: [ None ]
- **Arguments**: [ None ]
- **Outputs**: The function echoes whether the fetch and source operations were successful or failed. 
- **Returns**: 2 if the fetch or source operations failed; nothing if successful.
- **Example Usage**: 
  ```shell
  bootstrap_get_functions
  ```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Ensure URL sanitation: For enhanced security and stability, it's crucial to guarantee that the URL used in the curl command is well-formed and devoid of harmful characters or injections.
2. Employ robust error handling: If the curl command fails to retrieve the data for any reason, the entire function will fail. To prevent this, incorporate more extensive error handling.
3. Add a timeout to the curl function: To prevent the script from hanging indefinitely if the server does not respond, it's advisable to implement a timeout feature.
4. Implement HTTPS: For the sake of security, it would be better to use a secure HTTPS connection instead of HTTP while making curl requests.
5. Verify SSL certificate: When using HTTPS, it would be beneficial to confirm the SSL certificate to prevent Man-in-The-Middle attacks.
6. Use explicit variable declarations: The script could cause unforeseen problems if global variables with similar names exist elsewhere in the script. Hence, it's important to make all variable declarations as local as possible.
