### Function Overview

The function `ipxe_init` is designed to configure a network boot environment when the host isn't known yet because its MAC address hasn't been retrieved. It uses iPXE, an open-source boot firmware, to request the boot configuration from a server specified by the `CGI_URL` global variable. Once the configuration has been loaded, the iPXE shell executes it. If no configuration exists for the host, the function includes commented out code that handles this scenario by sending a message to the console and rebooting though this should never be the case as the boot manager is expected to create it.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** ipxe_init
- **Description:** This function initializes iPXE, a network boot firmware, and fetches and executes the boot configuration from a remote server. This function is utilized in situations where the cluster is configured but the host is not yet known due to a missing MAC address.
- **Globals:** 
  - `CGI_URL`: This global variable holds the URL of the remote server from which the boot configuration will be requested.
- **Arguments:** This function doesn't require any arguments.
- **Outputs:** The function produces a console output of the actions taking place including the fetching and loading of the boot configuration and its execution status.
- **Returns:** This function doesn't return any value because it's operations are all about booting a system with iPXE.
- **Example Usage:**
   ```
   ipxe_init
   ```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. The function contains commented out code which handles a situation where the configuration for the given MAC address is not found on the remote server. It would be better to uncomment these lines to account for this exception.
2. The global variable `CGI_URL` should be sanitized before using it in the function to prevent potential command injection.
3. For recovery and fault tolerance, consider adding a retry mechanism for fetching the configuration from the remote server if it fails at the first attempt.
4. Make sure to use secure transport (HTTPS not just HTTP) for fetching the configuration to prevent potential man-in-the-middle attacks.
5. Enhance logging with error levels, and make use of a logging system that supports searching and filtering, which would help in troubleshooting and incident response.
