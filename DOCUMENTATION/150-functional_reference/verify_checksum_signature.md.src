Function signature: 6927fb684cf8e6a1fa690734435cbce8b702cdeef1affb7a199413ba1ed2e406

### Function Overview

The `verify_checksum_signature` function takes four positional arguments to define the type of ISO file to check and the location from where to fetch the ISO's CHECKSUM and GPG key. This function is designed to verify the integrity and authenticity of a downloaded ISO file according to the checksum and GPG signature fetched from the file's distribution server. 

Currently, the function only supports the Rocky Linux distribution.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `verify_checksum_signature`
- **Description:** This function verifies a specified ISO checksum and GPG signature to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the file.
- **Globals:** 
  * `HPS_DISTROS_DIR` (Defaults to `/srv/hps-resources/distros`): Specifies the directory of the distros.
- **Arguments:** 
  * `$1 (cpu)`: Specifies the CPU architecture.
  * `$2 (mfr)`: Specifies the manufacturer.
  * `$3 (osname)`: Specifies the operating system name.
  * `$4 (osver)`: Specifies the operating system version.
- **Outputs:** Various status updates printed to the console. Error messages are redirected to standard error.
- **Returns:** `0` on success, `1` if there is an error (such as the ISO not being found, a failed download, checksum mismatch, or signature verification failure).
- **Example Usage:**
    ```bash
    verify_checksum_signature "x86_64" "rocky" "rockylinux" "8"
    ```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. The function could benefit from input validation to ensure the provided `cpu`, `mfr`, `osname`, and `osver` arguments are in the expected formats before they are concatenated into URLs.
2. The function may need to be modified to handle ISO files for operating systems other than Rocky Linux.
3. Consider the implementation of stronger error handling rather than simply returning `1` on an error. Detailed and distinct exit codes may help to better identify specific issues that could occur.
4. The echoing of status updates could be optionally silenced for running the script in a quiet mode.
5. Temporary directories and files should be securely deleted to prevent sensitive information from being exposed on the server.
6. Implement HTTPS download error handling to improve security and stability. This could be accomplished within the `curl` command statements.
