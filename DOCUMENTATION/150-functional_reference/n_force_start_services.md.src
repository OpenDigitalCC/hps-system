Function signature: 7f43681f2f170c1a4dd9b133c2e8539a06c8e5b262636f6cb4d83f6dc823b233

### Function overview

The `n_force_start_services` function is used to ensure the "dbus" and "libvirtd" services are running on a system, starting them directly if necessary rather than relying on the system's init process. The function logs what it's doing for tracking purposes and handles the creation of necessary directories and files for running these services, such as a unique machine-id for dbus and a pid-file for libvirtd.

### Technical description

**Name**: `n_force_start_services`

**Description**: This function forces the start of the dbus and libvirtd services, bypassing the init process. It checks if these services are already running; if not, it directly starts them and creates required folders and files. If a service fails to start, the function will return an error.

**Globals**: None

**Arguments**: None

**Outputs**: Logs to a remote logging function, `n_remote_log`, about the status of starting services.

**Returns**: The function returns `0` if all services were started successfully or were already running. It returns `1` if the libvirtd service failed to start.

**Example Usage**: 

```
n_force_start_services
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Validate the success of directory creation - Currently, the function assumes that `mkdir` operations will always succeed. It may be prudent to confirm their success before proceeding.
2. Use absolute paths - To avoid any mistakes caused by the present working directory, use absolute paths whenever possible.
3. Consider adding error handling for the dbus-uuidgen command as currently its potential failure isn't addressed.
4. Enhanced logging - Depending on the system's logging solution, it might be appropriate to log to more than just a remote log function. Perhaps logging to syslog, capturing error outputs, or raising the severity of tmessages if services fail to start.
5. Generally, it is unsafe to force start of services by bypassing the init system. Instead, one should attempt to resolve the underlying problem that prevents services from starting normally. This function should be treated as a workaround in critical situations, rather than a permanent solution.
