### Quality and security recommendations

1. Sanitize input: Always check and sanitize the inputs provided by the user to avoid any sort of injection or overflow attacks.
2. Error handling: The current function only returns 1 when an error condition is met. However, different error codes can be returned for different error situations to improve error understanding and debugging.
3. Usage of variables: Avoid using global variables as it might lead to unexpected results if multiple functions are modifying them at the same time.
4. Documentation: Maintain proper comments and explanation for the different parts of the function. This will help other developers understand the functionality quickly and accurately.
5. Functional scope: Be clear about the function scope. A function named "node_zvol_list" should ideally only list node zvols and not do anything else. This will maintain the function's purity and make it easier to debug and maintain.
6. Exit early: If a conditional check fails, exiting the function as soon as possible can enhance the performance and readability of the code.
