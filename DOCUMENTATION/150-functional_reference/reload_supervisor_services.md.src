### Function overview

`reload_supervisor_services` is a Bash function that reloads services managed by [Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/). The function is capable of reloading a specific service or all services based on the provided argument. During the reloading process, it validates the Supervisor configuration file and sends a HUP (Hang UP) signal to the target service(s). 

### Technical description

**Name:** `reload_supervisor_services`

**Description:** This function is used to reload services managed by Supervisor, It sends a HUP signal to the services which informs them to close and reopen their log files. If a specific service name is given, it sends the signal to the specified service otherwise all of the services are signaled. It checks if the Supervisor configuration file exists and if it does not, it logs an error and returns.

- `SUPERVISORD_CONF`: specifies the path of the supervisor configuration file.

**Arguments:** 
- `$1`: name of the service to be reloaded. If this argument is not given, the function will send the signal to all services.

- `0`: if the HUP signal is sent successfully.
- `1`: if the `SUPERVISORD_CONF` global variable is not set, or the supervisor configuration file does not exist.
- `2`: if the HUP signal fails.

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Add input validation for the service name parameter to prevent the function from accepting arbitrary user input. 
2. Due to indirect use of variables in the command line (`"$target"`), it is advisable to use arrays to avoid misinterpretation of any special characters in the commands.
3. Use absolute file paths for the supervisor configuration file, which makes your script more robust and less error-prone.
4. Avoid using `2>&1`, which combined stdout and stderr because it can cause potential issues with parsing and troubleshooting.
5. Log all relevant function events at the appropriate verbosity level for easier debugging and greater transparency of its activities.
6. Always consider using `-e` bash option to force your script to exit with non-zero automatically when any command fails. This will make your script more reliable.
7. Check if the required commands (`supervisorctl`, `sed`, `tr`) are available before using them.
