Function signature: 618a6b47c51365d7704455f712c3beca1d289fd4105a628552ebf67c3fbc5573

### Function Overview

The Bash function `node_lio_start` is designed to start a "target service" in a Linux environment, using systemd's `systemctl` command. It does this through calling `systemctl start target`, which starts the target service, and `systemctl enable target`, which ensures that the service will be started at boot time. Log messages are sent to a remote server via a function called `remote_log` before starting the service and after either successfully starting the service or failing to do so. A success or failure status is indicated by returning 0 or 1 respectively.

### Technical Description

Below is a technical description of the `node_lio_start` function:

- **name**: `node_lio_start`
- **description**: A Bash function designed to start a "target service" using systemd's `systemctl` command. Also ensures said service will be started at boot, and records the result (either success or failure) by sending a log message to a remote server.
- **globals**: None.
- **arguments**: None.
- **outputs**: Logs messages to a remote server indicating the process of starting and enabling the service.
- **returns**: 
  - 0 if the service is successfully started and enabled.
  - 1 if either starting or enabling the service failed.
- **example usage**:
  ```bash
  node_lio_start
  ```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Always ensure the `remote_log` function is properly defined in the same shell environment where `node_lio_start` is called to avoid errors.
2. Implement error catching for case when `systemctl` command is unknown, i.e., systemd isn't in use.
3. Safeguard this function with user and permission checks to ensure only authorized personnel or scripts can initiate systemd services.
4. Incorporate status checks before starting the service to prevent launching an already running service. 
5. Add more logging for better troubleshooting, such as logging the status code of the `systemctl` command.
