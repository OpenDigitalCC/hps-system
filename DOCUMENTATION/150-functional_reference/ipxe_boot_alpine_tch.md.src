### Function overview

The `ipxe_boot_alpine_tch` function boots an Alpine Linux system using Internet Packet eXchange Environment (iPXE) with specific settings. The function retrieves the latest version of Alpine Linux, configures the network settings using the host and cluster configurations, and generates an Alpine apkvol file if it doesn't already exist. It then prepares the kernel arguments for the boot process, sets up the iPXE header, and creates the boot script with the necessary kernel and initrd URLs, along with the generated kernel arguments.

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Always validate input parameters. In this function, mac address is an input parameter. Ensure that it is a valid mac address before processing.
2. Avoid using hard-coded IP addresses or hostnames. If possible, these parameters should be configurable or defined as constants at the top of your script.
3. Avoid the command injection vulnerability by always escaping or validating any input that is incorporated into shell commands.
4. Error handling needs to be in place wherein each command's return status should be checked to ensure the task was completed successfully before proceeding.
