Contained in `lib/functions.d/configure-remote-host.sh`

Function signature: 510e95a7ea40a9fb7173fdeeb81b4d5e94033f079c1adf146dddc4040cf4b9c0

### Function Overview

The function `bootstrap_get_provisioning_node` is designed to retrieve the default gateway IP which is also known as the provisioning node. It does so by using the `ip route` command piped into an `awk` command, which finds the line starting with 'default', and then prints the third field from that line before exiting. The resulting output is the IP address of the default gateway on the network.

### Technical Description

**Name:** `bootstrap_get_provisioning_node`

**Description:** This function retrieves the IP address of the default gateway in a given network, otherwise referred to as the provisioning node.

**Globals:** None

**Arguments:** This function does not take any arguments

**Outputs:** The IP address of the default gateway (provisioning node)

**Returns:** Exit status of the command used within the function. If successful, the function will return the exit status 0, reflecting the successful execution of the `ip route` and `awk` commands. However, if either command fails, the function will return the non-zero exit status of the failed command.

**Example usage:**

```bash
provisioning_node=$(bootstrap_get_provisioning_node)
echo "The current provisioning node's IP is $provisioning_node"
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

To improve the quality and security of this function, consider the following:

1. Check the availability of the `ip` and `awk` commands before running them. This can prevent errors in environments where these commands might not be available.
2. Handle errors explicitly. Currently, the function assumes that the commands will execute without error. Handling possible errors can make the function more robust and easier to debug.
3. Validate the IP address obtained. Although unlikely, the `awk` command might return a non-IP-address string under unusual circumstances. Validating the output can prevent bugs later in the script.
4. Ensure correct routing table. The script assumes that the user intends to use the default IP routing table. If there are additional routing tables, this might not work as expected. This should be considered in more complex network setups.
