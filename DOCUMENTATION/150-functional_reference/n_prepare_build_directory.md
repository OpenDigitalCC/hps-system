Function signature: da5d976a232d610c6dee7320c9a7dd5f46b21af2840c2356476910456cae90e6

### Function overview

This Bash function `n_prepare_build_directory` is used to prepare a directory for building the Opensvc version specified by `OPENSVC_VERSION`. It verifies the existence of the source directory, creates a temporary build directory, makes sure the directory does not already exist, copies the source tree to the build directory, and sets up the Go build environment for static compilation.

### Technical description

- **Name**: `n_prepare_build_directory`
- **Description**: Prepare directory for building OpenSVC. The function assumes that `OPENSVC_VERSION` and `source_dir` are set.
- **Globals**: [ `OPENSVC_VERSION`: The version of OpenSVC to use for building, `OPENSVC_BUILD_DIR`: The directory to use for building OpenSVC, `CGO_ENABLED` : Flag indicating whether to use Go build environment for static compilation ]
- **Arguments**: None
- **Outputs**: Warnings or errors if the source directory does not exist, the build directory exist already or the build directory is unable to be created. It also provides information on the build and the version.
- **Returns**: 
  - 1 if `OPENSVC_VERSION` is not set, source directory does not exist or if it fails to create or delete the build directory
  - 0 if the build directory has been prepared successfully
- **Example usage**:
```
export OPENSVC_VERSION=2.0
n_prepare_build_directory
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Consider making the `source_dir` a script parameter or a global configuration so as to avoid hard coding paths within functions.
2. It might be better to notify the user that the build directory is being deleted. They may have files in there which they didn't realize would be this function's responsibility.
3. To prevent potential directory traversal or file overwrite attacks, ensure that the value of `OPENSVC_BUILD_DIR` is controlled or validated.
4. The error messages printed by this function could be standardized and written in a dedicated error handling function, to make them easier to manage and keep the codebase DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
5. Run static analysis tools to catch more nuanced potential security issues such as format string vulnerabilities, buffer overflows etc.
