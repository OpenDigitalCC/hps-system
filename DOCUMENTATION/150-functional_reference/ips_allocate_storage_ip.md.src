### Function overview

The `ips_allocate_storage_ip()` function in Bash is designed to allocate an IP address from the storage network to a specific Source MAC address (source_mac). It first checks if an IP address has been already allocated to the given MAC, and in that case, returns the existing allocation. If not, it gets the storage network configuration, extracts the network prefix and builds a list of used IPs for this storage network. It then assigns an IP that falls in the range of 100 to 250 and isn't already in use. If it runs out of IPs in the range, it logs an error message and ends the function. Otherwise, the function coordinates the allocation and stores it, logging an information message and returning the new configuration.

### Technical description

##### Name:
`ips_allocate_storage_ip()`

##### Description:
Allocates an IP address from a storage network to a given MAC address.

##### Globals:
- `storage_index`: Index of the storage space.
- `source_mac`: MAC address passed by the n_ips_command framework.

##### Arguments:
- `$1`: The index of the storage (default value is 0).
- `$2`: The MAC address to which an IP address will be allocated.

##### Outputs:
A string formatted "vlan_id:ip_address:netmask:gateway:mtu"

##### Returns:
- `0` if allocation is successful.
- `1` if no available IPs are found within a specified range in the storage network.

##### Example usage:
`ips_allocate_storage_ip 1 "00:11:22:33:44:55"`

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Consider implementing input validation to ensure that the input MAC address (and the optional storage index) is in valid format.
2. Ensure the file permissions for script are properly secured to prevent unauthorized access or modification.
3. Handle exceptions and errors properly: In this script, if an available IP is not found in the given range, the script simply logs an error message and returns. It could be more useful to have a fallback strategy or retry mechanism here.
4. Keep the script up-to-date with current best practices relating to IP address allocation and network configuration.
5. Consider refactoring some parts of the function to minimize complexity and improve readability and maintainability. You might break up larger sections into smaller helper functions, each with a single, clear responsibility. This will also aid in unit testing individual components of the functionality.
