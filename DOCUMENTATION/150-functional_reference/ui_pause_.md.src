### 2. Technical description

- Description: The function is used to create a pause in the execution of your Bash script until the user manually presses the [Enter] key. This serves as a beneficial breakpoint utility for troubleshooting or pacing the script execution.
- Globals: None
- Arguments: None

### 3. Quality and security recommendations

1. For security purposes, be cautious while using user input in your scripts to prevent any potential injection attacks.
2. Always validate and sanitize user input, this helps to improve code quality and security.
3. In order to ensure the response from user is indeed an [Enter] key, check ASCII value of the user input.
4. Ensuring that written scripts are easily readable and maintain efficiency, as this function can be used throughout, creating a standalone utility function in a different bash file for such repetitive tasks can be beneficial. 
5. Always ensure to comment and document your code properly, to ensure others can understand and maintain it.
