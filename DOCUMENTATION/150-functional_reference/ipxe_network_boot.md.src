### Function Overview

The `ipxe_network_boot` function is designed to initiate a network boot process for a given host with a specific machine access code (MAC) address. This function uses the parameters of the host to prepare for the relevant boot process, identifying the host type and checking for necessary operating system dependencies before initiating the boot. In case of any errors or failures during these preliminary checks, the function will output log messages for debugging purposes.

### Technical Description

- **name:** `ipxe_network_boot`
- **description:** The function triggers the network booting of a device with a specific MAC address. The function initiates a network boot based on the host type, verifying the necessary OS dependencies, logging the operations and handling any errors.
- **globals:** 
    - `mac`: The MAC address of the device to be network booted.
- **arguments:**
    - `$1`: The MAC address of the device to be network booted. 
- **outputs:** The function outputs log messages describing its actions and any errors or fails it encounters.
- **returns:** The function will output `1` if it encounters an issue such as failing to validate the Alpine repository, otherwise no explicit return.
- **example usage:** `ipxe_network_boot 00:11:22:33:44:55`

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Make use of rigorous input validation for the MAC address to ensure that it meets the expected character length and hexadecimal format.
2. Ensure thorough logging processes are in place. This will help in understanding and debugging processes in the future.
3. Silent failure returns should be avoided. The function should always output a value to let us know its state.
4. Handle scenarios where `host_type` is not defined.
5. Constantly update and safeguard the Alpine repository to prevent any malicious attacks or alterations since this function heavily relies on it.
6. Implement functionality to handle more host types, as currently only host type 'TCH' is supported.
7. Document error codes in a separate file for best practices and easier debugging process.
