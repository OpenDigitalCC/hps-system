Function signature: f167df149452fd670d9f40bd87d52442f2f5d5153026bdfcab5f9c60997d7f96

### Function Overview

The bash function `detect_call_context` is designed to identify and echo the current context in which the script is being executed. It handles three main contexts: when the script is sourced instead of directly executed, when it gets invoked as a common gateway interface (CGI), and finally, when it gets directly executed in a shell or reading from stdin without CGI environment variables. If none of these contexts apply, the function defaults to "SCRIPT".

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `detect_call_context`
- **Description:** This function identifies the context in which the script is running, which could be either "SOURCED", "CGI", or "SCRIPT". It prints out the current context and then returns.
- **Globals:** [ BASH_SOURCE[0]: Describes the source of the bash script, GATEWAY_INTERFACE: A required variable to detect CGI, REQUEST_METHOD: Another required variable to detect CGI, PS1: Helps in explicitly detecting the script ]
- **Arguments:** None
- **Outputs:** Prints one of the four possible states - "SOURCED", "CGI", "SCRIPT", or a fallback "SCRIPT".
- **Returns:** `null`
- **Example Usage:**
  ```
  source your_script.sh
  detect_call_context
  ```  
  This script would output "SOURCED" if `your_script.sh` contains a call to this function.
  
### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. It is essential that global variables are well-defined and adequately protected in a function. Use local variables or provide default values to prevent empty or undefined global variables issues.
2. Bash lacks some advanced features like well-defined namespaces, classes, or functions. For better security and efficiency, consider using a more powerful scripting language like Python or Perl for complex scripts.
3. Make sure that the script running the function has appropriate permissions. Bash scripts can be a significant security risk if they are writable by any user. Therefore, secure your script by limiting access.
4. Implement error handling and fallbacks for unexpected behaviour or exceptions.
5. The function implicitly trusts that certain global environment variables are not maliciously set. Ensure that these environment variables are validated before use.
6. Regularly update your system and software to prevent security vulnerabilities.
