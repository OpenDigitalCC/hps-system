### Function overview

The function `n_bootstrap_get_functions` is used primarily for retrieving and sourcing the bootstrap functions required for a specified Linux distribution (distro). When called, it first initializes the distro string and gets the gateway address. It then creates a URL that specifies the `node_get_functions` command for the specific distro on the bootstrap server. The fetched functions are sourced in the current shell, allowing them to be utilised later in the script. If unable to fetch or source the functions, it outputs a fail message and returns an error status of `2`.

### Quality and security recommendations

1. It is usually more secure to use HTTPS protocol rather than HTTP in the URL for secure data transmission.
2. Verify the accuracy of the URL components like gateway and distro before using them.
3. Check the reliability of the variable `url` as itâ€™s constructed using a number of other variables, which may cause a risk if not properly validated.
4. Implement error handling mechanisms to assist with troubleshooting, beyond just printing error messages and return codes.
5. For improved code readability, work on refining the comments within the function to succinctly and accurately describe each action.
