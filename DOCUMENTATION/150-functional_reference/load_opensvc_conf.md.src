Function signature: 34b85a1047a61b533260c1512950ed5d8805b33c625908de3bcc4caf2d262537

### Function Overview

This function, `load_opensvc_conf()`, is mainly used to fetch, validate, and load the OpenSVC configuration from a specified gateway. The function performs the following actions:

1. Resolves a provisioning node.
2. Creates a directory for the configuration file if it does not already exist.
3. Downloads and temporarily stores the configuration file from the gateway.
4. Checks the integrity of the fetched configuration file.
5. If the fetched file is unchanged, it discards the temporary file and logs a message stating that there is no need to restart.
6. If the file has changed, it makes a backup of the current configuration file, replaces it with the new one, and restarts the daemon.

### Technical Description

- Function: `load_opensvc_conf()`
- Description: The function fetches, checks, and loads a new opensvc conf file from a specified gateway. If the file is new or modified, it backs up the old file, installs the new one, and restarts necessary services.
- Globals: `conf_dir`: The directory where the OpenSVC configuration file is stored,`conf_file`: The OpenSVC configuration file.
- Arguments: None.
- Outputs: Logs a message regarding the process completion status and potential error messages to the corresponding system log.
- Returns: `0` if the function successfully completes all its tasks and `1` if any of the tasks encounter an issue that causes it to terminate.
- Example usage: This function is not intended to be invoked with any command-line arguments and thus its usage is simply: `load_opensvc_conf`.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Always ensure the validity of the configuration file source (the "gateway") by using trusted certificates.
2. Make sure that the user running the script has proper permissions for all the necessary operations, like creating directories, fetching data, and restarting services.
3. It would be beneficial to implement more sophisticated error handling for the various stages of the function.
4. Strengthen the validation checks for the fetched configuration file.
5. When running the `curl` command, use the `-S` or `--show-error` flag to ensure error messages are displayed if an error occurs.
6. Use the `-s` or `--silent` with `curl` to not show progress meter but still show error messages.
7. To protect the original file, make a backup copy before making changes.
8. Encrypt sensitive parts of the configuration file to ensure security.
9. Use detailed log entries for any operation in order to trace back in case of any issue.
10. Always check the return status of each command, rather than assuming it will succeed. This will help to capture and handle any errors.
