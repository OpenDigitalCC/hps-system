### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. Enforce input validation not only for `item` but also for `mac` to ensure the inputs provided are in the correct format, improving reliability and preventing potential injection attacks.
2. Ensure there is a default error or exception handling mechanism in place for cases when an unexpected error occurs during the execution of a command, improving fault tolerance.
3. Include logging for all important actions and decisions made during the function's execution, providing visibility into its operations and aiding in debugging.
4. Centralize error messages to facilitate updates and maintain consistency across the application, improving maintainability and user experience.
5. Enforce least privilege principle by only assigning minimum required permissions to the function (or the user executing the function) to prevent potential misuse and mitigate damage from potential vulnerabilities.
