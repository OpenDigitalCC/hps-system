### Function Overview

The `n_configure_reboot_logging` function configures the logging for the reboot process on a TCH (Thomas Cook Holidays) node. It outputs status messages, creates directories, fixes broken symlinks for commands such as `reboot`, `poweroff`, and `halt`, creates wrapper scripts, handles shutdown, sets `PATH`, adds the OpenRC shutdown hook, and finally verifies the set up. The function makes use of `n_remote_log` and `n_remote_host_variable` functions to remit logs to the remote endpoint and set variables on the remote host. This function is primarily used to keep a track of the reboot process in a distributed system scenario and is an integral part of system maintenance and debugging procedures.

### Technical Description

```yaml
name: n_configure_reboot_logging
description: This function configures reboot logging on a TCH node. It makes sure that /usr/local/sbin exists then it fixes any broken symlinks for the commands reboot, poweroff, and halt. The function creates wrapper scripts for each command. The function handles shutdown, ensures /usr/local/sbin is first in PATH, adds the OpenRC shutdown hook and finally verifies the setup.
globals: []
arguments: []
outputs: Logs to the remote endpoint and sets variable on the remote host on the success or failure of each operation within the function. 
returns: This function always returns 0 after successful operation. Any error condition needs to be reliably resolved within the function itself.
example usage: This function is called without any parameters. Call it like this: `n_configure_reboot_logging`.
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. The function can be made more robust by adding error checks after each operation and returns or logs in case of failure. Maximum reliance on successful operation may lead to silent failures.

2. Instead of hardcoding paths like /sbin, /usr/local/sbin in the script, they should be stored in variables at the beginning of the function. This would make the function more versatile and easier to maintain.

3. The function lacks file and directory permissions checks. For example, in some cases, the function might fail due to missing permissions to create directories, remove or create files. Proper permissions checks should be added before file and directory manipulation operations.

4. Although grep ensures that `PATH` modification is not duplicated in `/etc/profile`, it is recommended to add a check for `/usr/local/sbin` is in `PATH` before adding to avoid any potential duplication.

5. It is recommended to test the existence of `n_remote_log` and `n_remote_host_variable` before using them. If these functions are not available, the function should return an error or fallback to local logging or variable setting.

6. The focus should be on reducing global and environmental side effects. For example, modifying `PATH` globally in `/etc/profile` might have unforeseen side effects. This should be well documented and considered in the implementation and usage of the function.
