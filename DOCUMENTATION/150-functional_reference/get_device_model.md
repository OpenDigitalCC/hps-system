### Function overview

The `get_device_model()` function in Bash is used to get the model of a specific device. It takes a device identifier as an argument and then accesses the corresponding system information to return the model of the device. If the function cannot find the specified device, or if any other error occurs, it will return a string saying "unknown".

### Technical description

- **Name:** get_device_model
- **Description:** This function retrieves the model of a device given its identifier. It looks in the "/sys/block" directory, removes any whitespace, and then returns the model of the device. If the system cannot find the model for any reason, it reports "unknown".
- **Globals:** None.
- **Arguments:** 
  - `$1: dev` - This is the identifier of the device whose model is being retrieved 
- **Outputs:** Model of the device or "unknown" if the device model can't be found.

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Implement error checking for the `cat` command.
2. Check the validity of the input device identifier before processing.
3. Provide a more descriptive error message.
4. Sanitize the input to avoid command injection vulnerabilities.
5. Handle device names that contain spaces correctly.
6. Implement proper logging to understand the behavior of the function in case of failures.
