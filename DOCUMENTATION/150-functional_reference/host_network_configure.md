Contained in `lib/functions.d/host-functions.sh`

Function signature: 8cd2d827ef31d1bf69059fb464c2261c8c3d0c359949b29cc3d9e2124e82ea48

### Function overview

The `host_network_configure` function is primarily responsible for assigning a unique IP and hostname to a specific host identified by a MAC address in a cluster network. This assignment is necessary for effective networking within the cluster. Apart from this, the function also conducts the validation of various inputs. It calls helper functions to get: the current configuration using `cluster_config helper`, the host's current IP address using `host_config helper`, assigned IPs and existing hostnames using `get_cluster_host_ips and get_cluster_host_hostnames helpers`. The function relies on other helper functions for data processing including: validating IP addresses, converting CIDR to netmask, and converting IP addresses to integers and vice-versa. The function also handles errors and logs information at every crucial step.

### Technical description

- **name**: host_network_configure
- **description**: Assigns a unique IP address and hostname to a specific host in a cluster network using its MAC address as identification. The function validates all the inputs and handles errors effectively.
- **globals**: None
- **arguments**: [ $1: MAC address of the host to be configured (`string`), $2: the type of host (`string`) ]
- **outputs**: None
- **returns**: 0 if successfully configured host; 1 in various failure cases
- **example usage**: `host_network_configure "00:0a:95:9d:68:16" "physical"`

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Handling input parameters should cater for malformed inputs (i.e., non-string types for `macid` and `hosttype`).
2. When dealing with IP and hostname validation, additional layers of security checks could be enforced to prevent injection or scripting attacks.
3. Use of a formal logging system would be beneficial for easier future debugging since current logging lacks levels of severity.
4. Code comments are clear but could be enhanced for better understanding of subprocesses within loops.
5. While the function captures errors during the processing of network configuration, printing of these errors would give users more insight into what went wrong.
6. To deal with possible race conditions during IP and hostname assignment, the introduction of locks or a queue system could help synchronize this crucial step.
7. Error handling should perhaps be updated to handle specific error cases, rather than general errors only. This would make the system more robust and easier to debug.
8. For function return values, using named constants instead of numbers could make the code more readable and maintainable.
9. Finally, this function could be broken down further into smaller subfunctions to make it easier to understand and test.
