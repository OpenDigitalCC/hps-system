### Function overview
The function `osvc_wait_for_socket`  is designed for waiting until the OpenSVC daemon socket becomes ready. It sends a debug log informing that it's waiting for the OpenSVC daemon socket. In a loop of 10 iterations, it checks if the daemon socket is ready and if so, it sends a debug log to confirm that the socket is ready and returns a success status. If the socket doesn't get ready within 10 seconds, an error log is sent indicating the socket's unavailability and the program is forced to exit with failure status.

### Technical description

- **Name:**

- **Description:** 
   Waits for the OpenSVC daemon socket to be ready.
- **Globals:** None 
- **Arguments:** None
- **Outputs:** Sends debug log about the status of the daemon, sends an error log if the OpenSVC daemon socket is not ready after 10 seconds.
- **Returns:** 
   `0` if the OpenSVC daemon socket is ready within 10 seconds, terminates with error status `1` otherwise.
- **Example usage:**
   
```bash
osvc_wait_for_socket

### Quality and security recommendations
1. The function could be improved to accept the socket path and timeout as arguments, instead of hardcoding the values. This will make the function more flexible and reusable.
2. The function uses `exit 1` in case of an error, which will terminate the whole script and not just the function. This could be inappropriate in some cases where the unavailability of the socket should not result in the termination of the whole script. It would be better to use something like `return 1` to just stop this function and return error status.
3. In terms of security, it is advisable to use `set -e` and `set -u` Bash options to handle unassigned variables and errors.
