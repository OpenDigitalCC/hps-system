### Quality and security recommendations

1. Provide a meaningful implementation: Currently, the function simply outputs some text and does not perform any configuration tasks. The function should be improved by adding meaningful logic that accomplishes the intended task of configuring TCH on an Alpine system.
2. Validation: If the function is updated to accept parameters, ensure that appropriate validation checks are in place to secure against injections or misusage.
3. Logging: Instead of using `echo` for logging, use a reliable logging mechanism to record important information, errors, warnings etc.
4. Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to anticipate the unexpected and handle any exceptions in a graceful manner.
5. Comments: Provide comprehensive comments for complex coding blocks to ensure maintainability and easy understanding of the code by other developers.
6. Secure Return Status: Choose correct status codes based on the function's execution, rather than simply returning 0, to make the function more reliable.
