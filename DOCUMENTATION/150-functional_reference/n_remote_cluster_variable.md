### Function overview

The function `n_remote_cluster_variable` is used to interface with a cluster, specifically to either set or get a variable. The function first checks if there are at least two arguments: the variable name and its value. If the function receives two arguments, it sets the variable with the provided name and value. If only the variable name is provided, it gets the value of the variable with that name. If the operation is successful, the function outputs the result and returns 0. Otherwise, it logs the error and returns the exit code.

### Technical description

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. There's no validation of input for variables $1 and $2, which could lead to unexpected behaviour or result in a security vulnerability. It's recommended to sanitize and validate the inputs for these variables.
2. Error messages should be more detailed, including the operation that failed, and if possible, the reason for the failure.
3. It's always good practice to comment on each block of the function. Proper commenting makes its understanding and debugging easier.
4. Global constants for error messages could be used to help homogenize the error handling across different functions.
