### Function overview

The `n_remote_cluster_variable` function in Bash sets or gets the value of a variable on a remote cluster. The variable `name` and `value` are defined as local variables within the function. If two or more arguments are passed to the function, the `SET` operation is executed to assign a value to the named variable in the cluster context. Conversely, if fewer arguments are given to the function, the `GET` operation is invoked to retrieve the value of the variable.

### Technical description
```pandoc
---
name: n_remote_cluster_variable
description: A bash function that allows to set or get variables on a remote cluster. It uses the `n_ips_command` utility function to communicate with the remote cluster.
globals: [ None ]
arguments: [ $1: The name of the variable that will be set or retrieved, $2: The value to set for the variable - only relevant for the SET operation ]
outputs: If the operation was successful, the function returns the output returned by the `n_ips_command`; otherwise, it throws an error.
returns: The command exit status. If the executed command was successful, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns a non-zero exit code.
example usage: `n_remote_cluster_variable "cluster_size" "10"` will set the variable `cluster_size` to `10` on the remote cluster. `n_remote_cluster_variable "cluster_size"` will retrieve the value of `cluster_size` from the cluster.

### Quality and security recommendations

1. To ensure security, make sure that the `n_ips_command` function communicates with the remote cluster over a secure protocol like SSH or TLS.
2. Always check the return value of the function for error handling. Catch the error to prevent unexpected behaviour in the larger program.
3. Make sure to handle user input properly, if the function arguments are directly or indirectly being supplied by the user.
4. Test this function thoroughly to validate both the functionality and error handling.
