Contained in `lib/functions.d/cluster-functions.sh`

Function signature: ff67ed1fe94af1bc0a6ebd9436efd66e00f5b5f9905b2979af037bdf49fce60e

### Function Overview
This function `set_active_cluster` is responsible for defining the active Kubernetes cluster by name, in a specific environment. It accomplishes this through several steps - assigning the input to a variable, checking to see if the input variable is empty, defining cluster directory and configuration file locations, ensuring both the directory and configuration file exist, and finally, linking to the active cluster.

### Technical Description
* __Name__: `set_active_cluster`
* __Description__: This function sets a specific Kubernetes cluster as active based on cluster name provided as an argument.
* __Globals__: None
* __Arguments__: 
    * `$1: cluster_name` - Name of the Kubernetes cluster to be set as active.
* __Outputs__: 
    * Echoes an error message and usage suggestion to stderr if no argument is supplied, or if cluster directory or configuration file cannot be found.
    * Echoes a success message if the active cluster is successfully set.
* __Returns__: 
    * Returns `1` if no argument is supplied or if cluster directory or configuration file cannot be found.
    * Returns `2` if clusted configuration not found.
* __Example usage__: 
```bash
set_active_cluster my_cluster_name
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. Input validation: Implement more comprehensive input validation; currently, the function only checks if an argument is supplied, but there might be specific naming rules for cluster names that could also be checked.
2. Error handling: More specific error messages could help with easier problem diagnostics.
3. Security: Review if and where this script allows for problems like symlink attacks; if a potential exists, steps should be introduced to minimize the risk.
4. Robustness: Consider introducing checks for edge cases such as file permission issues or lack of disk space. 
5. Testing: Incorporate this function in unit testing to ensure it continues to work correctly as the cluster environment evolves.
