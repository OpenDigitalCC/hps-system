### Function overview

The given function, `n_check_go_version_compatibility`, checks if the currently installed Go version is compatible with the Go version requirement specified in a particular git tag of a source repository. The source repository is located at `/srv/hps-resources/packages/src/opensvc-om3` by default. If the installed Go version is lesser than the required version, the function will return an error stating the incompatibility. If no Go version is required or Go isn't installed, corresponding warnings and errors will be returned.

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Ensure that the source code directory is a secure location and permissions are correctly set to avoid unauthorized access or modifications.
2. Use descriptive error messages to allow better debugging and troubleshooting.
3. Check if the git tag exists before proceeding with the rest of the function to avoid unnecessary operations.
4. Use secure methods to execute shell commands, to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
5. Function relies on local environment's Go installation and source code directory. These dependencies should be documented and managed properly.
6. The function assumes that Go versions only consist of major and minor versions. This might not be the case always, need to handle sub-minor versions as well.
