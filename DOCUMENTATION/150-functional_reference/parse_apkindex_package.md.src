### Function overview

The Bash function `parse_apkindex_package` is designed to parse APKINDEX files. The function takes a package name and APKINDEX file as arguments, then finds and prints the paragraph associated with the package name. A paragraph ends with a blank line in APKINDEX file. If it does not end with a blank line, then it checks the last record. The function returns `0` if the package details are found or `1` if the package was not found.

### Technical description

- **Name**: `parse_apkindex_package`
- **Description**: This function is used to read an APKINDEX file, paragraph by paragraph (blank-line separated), and find package information. The package information is then echoed (printed) to the console. If the file does not end with a blank line, it checks the last record for matching package information.
- **Globals**: None
- **Arguments**: 
  - `$1 (apkindex_file)`: The path of the APKINDEX file to be parsed.
  - `$2 (package_name)`: The name of the package for which information is sought.
- **Outputs**: Prints the information of the package found within the APKINDEX file.
- **Returns**: Returns `0` if the package details have been found in the APKINDEX and `1` if the package was not found.
- **Example Usage**: 
  ```bash
  parse_apkindex_package "./apkindex.txt" "mypackage"
  ```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Error Handling: The function currently doesn't handle possible exceptions. For instance, if the provided file is not accessible or does not exist.
2. Input Validation: There is currently no validation of inputs. This might lead to problematic behaviour if, for instance, an empty or incorrect APKINDEX filename or an empty package name is provided.
3. Documentation: The function could be clearer with more comments explaining any complex parts of the syntax used. Currently, there are no comments explaining what variables like `in_record` serve for, which might confuse other contributors or end users.
4. Efficiency: The function reads the file line by line, incurring heavy I/O operations. If the APKINDEX file is very large, this might not be efficient. There's room to optimize this for better performance.
