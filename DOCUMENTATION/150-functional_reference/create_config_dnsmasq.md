Function signature: 22bc6c19aa391d4d58e332e373400aad4f02035bedd99d8d94127662dcf30360

### Function Overview

The `create_config_dnsmasq` function in Bash is designed to effectively configure the dnsmasq server for DHCP, DNS, PXE, TFTP services and write to its configuration file. It considers parameters like the DHCP IP, DHCP Range Size, DHCP Interface, DNS Domain, from an external source. 

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `create_config_dnsmasq`
- **Description:** This function creates a configuration file for the `dnsmasq` service. It's generating a `dnsmasq.conf` file in the directory `${CLUSTER_SERVICES_DIR}` with the configuration details mentioned in the function. Particularly, it defines the system config, DHCP config, DNS config, TFTP, and PXE config settings within this file.
- **Globals:** `[ DHCP_IP: A global variable representing the DHCP IP that is required for the configuration of `dnsmasq` ]`
- **Arguments:** `[ $1: desc, $2: desc ]` (The function does not seem to take any explicit arguments, but it does use environment variables set outside the function.)
- **Outputs:** A successfully well configured `dnsmasq.conf` file.
- **Returns:** Logs if the `dnsmasq` configuration file was successfully generated or throws an error if the DHCP IP was not found.
- **Example usage:** 
  ```bash
  create_config_dnsmasq
  ```
### Quality And Security Recommendations

1. Instead of stopping the process with just an echo "[Error] No DHCP IP..." and exit 0 when there is no DHCP IP, a better error handling mechanism can be implemented. Exit code 0 usually indicates success, so a non-zero exit code might be more appropriate to signal the error in this case.
   
2. Check the existence of essential files (`${DHCP_ADDRESSES}` and `${DNS_HOSTS}`) at the beginning of the function and not just create them at the end. Raise an error if these are missing or not accessible at the beginning of script execution.
   
3. The permissions of `dnsmasq.conf` should be restricted to reduce security risks. The function could set proper permissions after creating the file (for example with `chmod`).

4. Make sure to validate input parameters thoroughly to prevent potential Command Injection issues. Command Injection can occur when unconstrained input is passed directly into a command shell.
   
5. HTTPS should be used instead of HTTP to ensure that the generated configuration file is transferred securely from the server to the client. It prevents the file's content from being intercepted and tampered with by attackers.
