### Function Overview

The function `hps_services_post_start()` is designed to configure the OpenSVC cluster whenever it's applicable. It's part of a larger system that manages High Performance Services (HPS). In the context of this system, post start refers to things that should happen after a service has been started, but before it's made available to end-users.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `hps_services_post_start`
- **Description:** This function is used to configure the OpenSVC cluster if it is applicable. OpenSVC is an 'Open Source Software' platform that provides a framework for managing services distributed across nodes. This function calls another function `hps_configure_opensvc_cluster` to do the actual configuration.
- **Globals:** `None`
- **Arguments:** `None` 
- **Outputs:** Depending on the implementation of `hps_configure_opensvc_cluster`, this function may output information related to the configuration process.
- **Returns:** Since this function does not explicitly return anything, it implicitly returns the exit status of the last command executed, which in this case would be `hps_configure_opensvc_cluster`.
- **Example usage:** 
    ```
    hps_services_post_start
    ```
