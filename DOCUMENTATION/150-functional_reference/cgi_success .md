### Quality and security recommendations
1. Input validation: Ensure that the input argument (`$1`) is being properly sanitized and validated. For example, it is checked for null values and potentially harmful characters that may cause unwanted actions when output.
2. Documentation: Each function should have a short comment explaining its purpose and any notable behaviors to aid future development and maintenance.
3. Error handling: Appropriate error handling procedures should be in place for when `cgi_header_plain` fails or generates an exception.
4. Provide a means for logging operations in order to aid debugging and provide transparency over the system's operations.
5. Coding standards: Follow good bash scripting practices, including usage of quotation marks around variable references and consistent indentation and naming conventions.
6. Secure practices: It's best not to display too much information in error messages, as this could potentially expose sensitive details which might be exploited by an attacker. The messages returned by this function should be reviewed for such concerns.
