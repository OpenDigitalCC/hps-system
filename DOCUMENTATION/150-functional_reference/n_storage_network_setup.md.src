Contained in `lib/host-scripts.d/common.d/n_storage-functions.sh`

Function signature: b9d955ab898629611ccbb3c79adf2cb697c037821b05b564e6e5b61ababbb529

### Function overview

The `n_storage_network_setup` function is utilized for setting up the storage network in a remote computing system. The function takes two arguments, physical interface and storage index. It retrieves the MAC address of the specified interface and requests an IP allocation from the IPS. In case of failure, an error message is logged and the function returns 1. If successful, the IP allocation response is parsed and utilized to create a VLAN and set up the IP address. The VLAN interface, IP, and gateway are stored as host variables and the gateway's reachability is tested.

### Technical description

- **name**: `n_storage_network_setup`
- **description**: This function sets up the storage network by creating a VLAN after obtaining an IP allocation from the IPS, sets up an IP address and tests the gateway for reachability. This function also stores the VLAN interface, IP, and Gateway as host variables.
- **globals**: None
- **arguments**: 
    - `$1: phys_iface` — The physical interface.
    - `$2: storage_index` — The storage index(defaults to 0).
- **outputs**: Logs messages regarding the IP allocation from IPS, VLAN creation, and gateway reachability.
- **returns**:  `1` if the IP allocation request is failed or empty. Also, `1` is returned if either VLAN creation or IP addition fails. Returns `0` if all operations are successful.
- **example usage**: 

```bash
n_storage_network_setup eth0 1
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Always check user permissions before running critical functions such as `n_storage_network_setup` to ensure security. You must have necessary privileges for operations like VLAN creation and IP allocation.
2. Robust error checking and handling could be provided for all stages within the function to offer better resiliency.
3. Avoid using hardcoded strings like `"ERROR"`. It's recommended to define them as constants at the start of the script or to gather them from a central configuration file.
4. Input validation should be performed to prevent any kind of script injection or faulty value passage.
5. Make sure to store sensitive data such as IP addresses securely and ensure they are clean up properly to avoid exposing any sensitive information.
6. Logging levels could be introduced to make troubleshooting easier in complex systems.
