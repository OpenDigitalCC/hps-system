2. **Log Rotation**: To manage the size of the logs properly, implement some type of log rotation either via a Bash script or a system utility.
3. **Permissions**: Ensure appropriate permissions are set on the log file to prevent unauthorised access or alteration of the logs.
4. **Sensitive Information**: Be cautious while logging messages as it should not include any sensitive data like passwords which can be exposed through logs.
