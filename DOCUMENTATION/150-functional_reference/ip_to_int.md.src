### Function Overview

This function named `ip_to_int`, takes an IP address as an argument and converts it into its equivalent integer representation. This is a common need in network programming. The function first validates the input using the `validate_ip_address` function. If the validation fails, it logs an error message using the `hps_log` function with the level set to error and then prematurely returns from the function with a return code of 1. If the validation succeeds, the IP address is then segmented into its four octets using the Internal Field Separator (IFS) and read into variables. Each octet is then bit-shifted appropriate number of places to the left, resulting in the equivalent integer value of the IP address.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `ip_to_int`
- **Description:** This function converts an IP address in string format to its equivalent integer representation.
- **Globals:** None
- **Arguments:** 
  - `$1: IP address in string format.`
- **Outputs:** 
  - If successful, prints the integer representation of the IP address to STDOUT. 
  - If not, logs an error message using the `hps_log` function.
- **Returns:** 
  - 0 if the IP address was successfully converted to integer. 
  - 1 if the IP address is not valid.
- **Example usage:** `ip_to_int "192.168.1.1"`

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. The validation function `validate_ip_address` called by `ip_to_int` should have rigorous checks to ensure that only a valid IP address can pass through to help maintain the security of the systems involved.
2. It's recommended to refactor the `hps_log` outside of this function and handle errors in the caller function. This can improve the reusability of this function.
3. Utilize proper error handling mechanisms to ensure system stability in precipitous situations.
4. Incorporate comprehensive testing to ensure the function behaves as expected in various scenarios.
5. Always sanitize input data before it's used within the function to prevent injection attacks.
