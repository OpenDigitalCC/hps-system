### Quality and security recommendations

1. Avoid usage of global variables as much as possible to reduce side effects and improve function modularity.
2. Input validation and error handling should be more rigorous. Check for the validity of MAC addresses before using them.
3. Preferably restrict access to root or privileged users to reduce potential security risks.
4. Avoid inlining large scripts. Use a separate file to manage large scripts.
5. Implement a logging mechanism to record errors and important events during installation.
6. If possible, encrypt sensitive data like IP addresses, hostnames, and other network details.
