Function signature: 581497653f8d51b9a4cbf2d4bf39d79e8c580671467d2b61a5c8dfd8654b0888

### Function Overview

The Bash `create_config_nginx()` function is clearly involved in the creation of an Nginx configuration file. It obtains a filename from the `get_active_cluster_filename` function (silencing error output), stores it within a local variable `NGINX_CONF`, and then writes a configuration template to it. 

### Technical Description

- **Name**: `create_config_nginx`
- **Description**: This function creates an Nginix configuration file.
- **Globals**: `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR`: This global variable holds the path to the service configuration directory.
- **Arguments**: None
- **Outputs**: Produces an Nginx configuration file in a specific location.
- **Returns**: Not explicitly defined in the code.
- **Example Usage**: Call the function without any arguments like so - `create_config_nginx`

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Handle errors from the `source` command: The function sources a file determined by the `get_active_cluster_filename` function but doesn't handle possible errors. To improve, check the file exists before sourcing it.

2. Manage permissions: Ensure that the script runs with enough, but not excess, privileges to write to `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR`.

3. Log or handle errors from `cat`: The function writes to a file, but any errors (e.g., from insufficient permissions, out-of-disk-space errors) are ignored. These should be logged or handled.

4. Validate variables: Validate the `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR` variable before using it. This could include checks to ensure it's a directory and has appropriate permissions.

5. Hardcoded configuration: The Nginx configuration is hardcoded into this function. It would offer more flexibility to load configuration from an external source, allowing for easy modification without requiring script changes.
