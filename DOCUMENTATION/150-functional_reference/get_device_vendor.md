### Function overview

The `get_device_vendor` function aims to find out and return the vendor information of a given device specified by the argument passed to the function. It is a bash function implemented to dive deep into system files to extract this information. If the information is not available or if the system encounters any error while trying to find out the information, it simply returns an "unknown" string.

### Technical description

- **Name:** get_device_vendor
- **Description:** This function retrieves the vendor information of a given device in a Linux-based operating system.
- **Globals:** None.
- **Arguments:** [ `$1`: The device (e.g., `/dev/sda`) for which to retrieve the vendor information.]
- **Outputs:** Prints vendor information to the standard output. If the vendor information could not be obtained, prints "unknown".
- **Returns:** None.
- **Example usage:** `get_device_vendor /dev/sda` _This will return the vendor information of the sda disk._

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Validate the input argument as a valid device before proceeding with the command to prevent unexpected behavior or potential security breaches.
2. Adding error checks and handling could improve the function further. Right now, if anything goes wrong, the function will simply print "unknown" which might not be the most informative way to handle errors in some cases.
3. Check for the appropriate permissions before trying to access system files. Your script might not work without the right permissions or in a restricted environment.
4. Include more detailed comments in the code to explain decision reasons and to clarify hard-to-understand parts. Even though the code looks simple, good commenting is a strong marker of software quality.
5. You should consider setting a stricter error handling policy, like `set -euo pipefail`, to make the script exit on the first error it encounters.
