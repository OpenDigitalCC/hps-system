### Quality and security recommendations

1. Ensure the file `/etc/os-release` is reliably secure because the function reads from it. In case the file doesn't exist or is corrupted, the output string may not be accurate.
2. Handle edge cases where the CPU architecture, manufacturer or operating system details cannot be obtained. Currently, the function would default to "unknown", which may not be the desired output.
3. Consider checking and validating input before processing it to better handle any unexpected or malformed input.
4. Always keep the system and its software up-to-date to ensure that the `uname` command and `/etc/os-release` file return reliable and accurate information.
5. Run this program with the least privilege necessary to reduce potential damage in the event of a bug or breach.
