### Function overview

The `write_cluster_config` function is designed to write a series of values (array) into a targeted configuration file. The function starts by checking the length of the array of values, and if empty, outputs an error message and returns 1 (indicating an error occurred). If the array is not empty, the function prints the values to the terminal and then writes the inter-space-separated values into the targeted file.

### Technical description

- **Name:** write_cluster_config
- **Description:** Writes an array of values to a targeted configuration file. Reports an error and returns 1 if the array is empty. Otherwise, prints the array of values to the screen and writes them to the file.
- **Globals:** None
- **Arguments:** [ $1: Target file for writing the array, $2: The array of values ]
- **Outputs:** "[x] Cannot write empty cluster config to $target_file" to stderr if the array is empty; otherwise, "Writing: ${values[*]}" and "[OK] Cluster configuration written to $target_file" to stdout.
- **Returns:** Returns 1 if the array is empty. Does not explicitly return a value otherwise.
- **Example usage:** 

```bash
write_cluster_config "config.txt" "value1" "value2" "value3"
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Consider validating file write operations: While the function currently reports whether a configuration file is written, it could potentially add error checking for the file write operation to catch and report errors.
2. Input validation: More robust validation of input arguments (such as checking if $1 is a valid file path) will help prevent accidental misuse of the function.
3. Atomic writes: Consider using atomic write operations to prevent potential race conditions or half-written files in case of errors or interruptions during write operations.
4. Secure handling of error messages: Rather than writing error messages to stderr, consider logging them securely in a way that would not expose potentially sensitive information.
5. Sanitization of inputs: Always sanitize inputs especially if they are used as part of a command to be executed to avoid command injection vulnerabilities.
