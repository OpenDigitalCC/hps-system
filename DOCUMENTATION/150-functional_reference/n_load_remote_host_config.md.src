### Function overview

The `n_load_remote_host_config` function is used to load the configuration of a remote host. First, it executes the `host_get_config` command of the `n_ips_command` function and stores the output in the variable `conf`. In case this operation fails, it reports the problem and terminates the operation with a return status of `1`. If the command is executed successfully, it proceeds to execute the contents of `conf`, essentially loading the remote host's configuration.

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Do an input validation check for `n_ips_command` to ensure only intended commands are executed.
2. Add better error handling for both expected and unexpected errors.
3. Provide a clear, user-friendly message for logging instead of just "Failed to load host config."
4. Avoid using `eval` due to security reasons as it allows command injection. If it's necessary to use `eval`, ensure the content of `conf` is strictly checked and sanitized.
5. Implement logging for the function's successful operation completion.
