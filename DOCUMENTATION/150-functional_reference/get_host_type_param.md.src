### Function overview

The `get_host_type_param()` function in Bash is designed to retrieve a specific value from an associative array, based on the provided key. This function takes in two parameters: the name of the associative array, and the key for which the value should be retrieved. The value corresponding to the given key is then echoed out, allowing the function's output to be captured and used elsewhere in the script.

### Technical description

- **Name:** `get_host_type_param()`
- **Description:** This Bash function retrieves a specific value from an associative array. The name of the associative array and the key are provided as input arguments. The function uses Bash's variable reference (`declare -n`) to reference the associative array, and then uses array indexing (`${ref[$key]}`) to fetch the value corresponding to the provided key.
- **Globals:** None
- **Arguments:** 
  - `$1 (type):` The name of the associative array from which to retrieve the value.
  - `$2 (key):` The key for which to retrieve the value from the associative array.
- **Outputs:** Echos out the value from the associative array that corresponds to the provided key.
- **Returns:** Does not return value.
- **Example usage:** `get_host_type_param "server_param" "ip_address"`

### Quality and security recommendations

1. It's important to ensure the arguments passed into this function (the name of the associative array and the key) are not controlled by untrusted user input, as this could potentially lead to unintended behavior.
2. Consider adding error checks in the function to handle cases where the provided associative array or key might not exist. Currently, if either the array or the key doesn't exist, the function won't return an error or warning, which might lead to bug diagnosis challenges.
3. It might be beneficial to enclose all variable references, including array indices, within double quotes. This will prevent word splitting and pathname expansion, which could lead to unexpected results in some cases.
