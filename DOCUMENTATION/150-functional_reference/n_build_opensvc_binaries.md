Contained in `lib/host-scripts.d/alpine.d/BUILD/10-build_opensvc.sh`

Function signature: 7cc90027c9d9a353b0cd467113ad5b2a624efc0d5c66c5eb4a1ce7cbd73ec71b

### 1. Function Overview 

The function `n_build_opensvc_binaries` is a shell script that builds the OpenSVC binaries. It checks certain environment variables for the build directory and OpenSVC version, and ensure the build directory exists. If the checks fail, the build process stops and returns an error. Upon successful verification of the build directory environment, the function navigates to the build directory, manages the git ownership, runs the make process, and checks and verifies the binaries. Once binaries are verified, their executability is ensured and the function returns a success status.

### 2. Technical Description

* **Name:** `n_build_opensvc_binaries`
* **Description:** The function is aimed at building OpenSVC binaries. It checks for environment variables, navigates to the correct directory, manages git directories, runs the make process and verifies the binaries. On successful completion, it ensures the executability of binaries and logs the successful build.
* **Globals:** `[ OPENSVC_BUILD_DIR: Directory for OpenSVC build, OPENSVC_VERSION: The version of OpenSVC for building binaries ]`
* **Arguments:** `[ None ]`
* **Outputs:** Messages indicating status of building process or error messages on unsuccessful operations.
* **Returns:** The function returns 1 in case of an error and 0 if the build process completes successfully.
* **Example Usage:** `n_build_opensvc_binaries`

### 3. Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Better error handling could be implemented for the process where environment variables are checked. If they are not set, this could still be resolved within the script rather than returning an error.
2. Ensure proper permissions for the build directory. Restrict unauthorized users from accessing the build directory to prevent malicious tampering with the binaries.
3. Implement proper logging mechanism. Currently, the error messages are only echoed and not logged which could make debugging issues harder in the future. 
4. Ensure user who is calling the script has adequate permissions to avoid potential permission issues.
5. Implement checksum verification after binaries are built to ensure the integrity of the binaries.
