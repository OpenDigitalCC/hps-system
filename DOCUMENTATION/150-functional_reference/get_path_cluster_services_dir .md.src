### Function overview

The `get_path_cluster_services_dir` is a Bash function that retrieves the path to the services directory of the currently active cluster on a system.

### Technical description

**Name:** `get_path_cluster_services_dir`

**Description:** This function builds and displays a file path to the services directory within the currently activated cluster on a system. This is achieved by concatenating the path of the active directory, as returned by the `get_active_cluster_dir` function, with the string `/services`.

**Globals:** None

**Arguments:** None

**Outputs:** A string representing the file path to the services directory within the active cluster directory.

**Returns:** The function does not explicitly return a value, but uses the `echo` command to pass the generated path as a string to the standard output.

**Example Usage:**
```bash
services_dir=$(get_path_cluster_services_dir)
echo $services_dir 
# Output: /path/to/active_cluster/services
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Checking for errors: The function should check the return code of `get_active_cluster_dir` to ensure it executed successfully before proceeding to append `/services` to it. This could prevent displaying or operating on invalid paths.
2. Managing permissions: The function works with file paths which could potentially expose sensitive directories. So it should be used with care, ensuring that permissions are set correctly.
3. Logging: Consider adding logging within the function to make debugging easier in future.
4. Input Validation: Although this function does not accept arguments, for general functions that do, it's crucial to validate and sanitize the inputs.
