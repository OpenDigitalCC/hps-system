### Function overview

The `cgi_success` function is a simple subroutine in Bash intended for use within the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) context. The function first emits the necessary headers for a plain-text CGI response via the `cgi_header_plain` subroutine. It then echoes the first parameter as the response body. This is typically used to send back a simple, plain-text success message to the client.

### Technical description

**Name**: `cgi_success`

**Description**: Executes a plain-text CGI success response. This is implemented by outputting the CGI headers for a plain-text response, followed by the response body as supplied by the first parameter.

**Globals**: None

**Arguments**:
- `$1`: The message to be echoed back as the body of the CGI response.

**Outputs**: 
- The complete CGI response, including headers and body, is output to STDOUT. Notably, this includes the result of the `cgi_header_plain` routine as well as the message from the `$1` argument.

**Returns**: None. Since this function prints directly to STDOUT, it does not produce a return value.

**Example Usage**:

```
cgi_success "Operation was successful."
```

Would generate the following output (headers omitted for brevity):

```
Operation was successful.
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Error Handling: Currently, the subroutine does not perform any sort of error checking on its input. It would be more robust to verify that the given input is safe and valid before attempting to send it as a response.

2. Documentation: It is currently not immediately clear what the purpose of this function is or how to use it from the function definition alone. More comprehensive inline documentation would be beneficial.

3. Security: Consider sanitizing the message argument to prevent a potential HTTP response splitting attack where end-of-line characters encoded in the response could enable an attacker to inject arbitrary headers or body content.

4. Code Modularity: The inclusion of the `cgi_header_plain` inside the `cgi_success` function decreases its modularity and reusability. Encapsulating each functionality in a discrete function would make the code more modular and simple to test.
