### 1. Function Overview

The `build()` function in Bash is a very basic one. Its primary role is to return a 0 status code. In Bash, a return code of 0 indicates a successful operation or execution. This means when the `build()` function is called, it simply returns without performing any operation, signaling that the command completed successfully.

### 3. Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Even though `build()` function does not contain any harmful operations, it's good to use code scanning tools for checking potential security lapses in complex scripts. 
2. The function name `build` seems a bit misleading as it doesn't actually build anything.
3. Always ensure that Bash functions are well-documented and reviewed by peers for improving the code quality.
4. Adopt proper error handling mechanism rather than just a binary 0 or 1 output. A more verbose error message may prove helpful in more complex scripts.
5. Expand the functionality of this function or reconsider its necessity, as its current form add no tangible output or process.
