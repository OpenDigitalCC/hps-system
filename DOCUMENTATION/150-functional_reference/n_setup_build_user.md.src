Function signature: 58d6f11cd02c168aafff4c94b7ac6ad26ba376a01adf30d89d7457f348a020c8

### Function overview

The `n_setup_build_user` function is used primarily for setting up a build user for APK package creation in a Linux environment. The function performs a series of tasks including checking if the specified build user exists, creating one if not, setting up a home directory for the user, ensuring the user is part of the 'abuild' group, creating a abuild signing key, and changing the permissions of a package directory.

### Technical description

**Name**: `n_setup_build_user`

**Description**: A Bash function used for setting up build user for APK package creation. It performs several key operations such as creating a user, setting up home directory and group memberships and generating a signing key for the user.

**Globals**: 
1. `build_user`: The name of the user that will be created for building the APK. Default value is 'builder'.
2. `packages_dir`: The directory on the system where APK packages are stored. Default value is '/srv/hps-resources/packages'.

**Arguments**: None

**Outputs**:
The function outputs a running commentary of its actions as it executes, e.g. 
"Creating build user builder...", "Creating home directory...", etc. 

**Returns**:
- 1 if it fails to create the build user or to generate the signing key.
- 0 after successfully setting up everything.

**Example Usage**:
```bash
n_setup_build_user
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Consider parameterizing the function to accept the `build_user` and `packages_dir` as arguments, rather than hardcoding them. This will improve flexibility.
2. Proper error handling can be enhanced by including more explicit error messages in case a step fails and possibly exiting the function.
3. Security can be improved by checking the privileges of the script executing this function. It requires substantial system permissions (e.g., creating a user, changing the directory's ownership) that could lead to unintended security vulnerabilities.
4. Check the script for the possible command injections, as it is executing system commands. Ensure that all variables used in commands are sanitized and safe to use.
