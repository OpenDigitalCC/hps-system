### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. Consider checking the status of the `echo` commands to ensure that they successfully sent the outputs.
2. If this function is used in a larger script, make sure that it's being called appropriately and that the output is being properly used.
3. Ensure secure execution with proper user privileges. Running the script with unnecessary admin rights can be a security risk.
4. Audit and keep a record of function usage in order to trace and troubleshoot any issues when they occur.
5. Include error handling to respond to failed operations and cleanly exit the script when necessary. This will prevent any misuse or security vulnerabilities.
