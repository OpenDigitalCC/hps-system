### Function overview

The function `disks_free_list_simple()` is a Bash script that lists all available block storage devices in a system. It singles out regular, non-removable hard drives, discounting specific types of block devices such as loop, ram, md, dm devices, or those with partitions. Moreover, the function ignores devices that are mounted, belong to LVM2, Linux RAID, ZFS storage pool, or exist in a zpool. Whenever possible, it prefers World Wide Name (WWN) identifier for device representation.
