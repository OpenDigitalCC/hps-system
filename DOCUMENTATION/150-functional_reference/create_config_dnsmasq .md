### Function overview

The function `create_config_dnsmasq` is utilized for setting up and configuring the dnsmasq service. This function generates dnsmasq configuration about System, DHCP, DNS, TFTP and PXE by defining specific parameters obtained from the cluster configuration.

### Quality and security recommendations

1. It's recommended to have error checking for all global variables used in this function to avoid misbehavior in case any of them is not defined.
2. Log all function execution and exit paths for debugging purposes and maintaining a traceable log of all actions taken by the function.
3. Check the result of the `cat` command for successful file creation and write in addition to the existence of the `DHCP_ADDRESSES` and `DNS_HOSTS` files.
4. Global variable names should be more descriptive to provide context about what value they should hold.
5. Avoid using `exit` function directly in the function; instead, return a status code and handle it in the caller function. Doing so allows for better error handling and script execution control.
