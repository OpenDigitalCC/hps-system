### Function Overview

The function `initialise_host_scripts` is a Linux bash script function that primarily fetches and sources a host functions script from a URL. It asks an external system (referred to as the provisioning node) for the proper distro string and fetches the appropriate host function script bundle, which it then sources for use in the current shell process. If this fetch and source operation fails, it raises an error and returns a non-zero exit status.

### Technical Description

- **name**: initialise_host_scripts
- **description**: A bash script function which fetches and sources a script for host functions from a given URL.
- **globals**: None
- **arguments**: None
- **outputs**: This function outputs various status messages to indicate progress of the operation. It also modifies the ongoing shell environment by sourcing the fetched host functions scripts.
- **returns**: When successful, the function completes silently with a zero exit status. If the fetch and source operation failure occurs, it gives an error message and returns a non-zero exit status.
- **example usage**:  
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. The function should validate the fetched script before sourcing it. The validity check could include size and content checks or even a signature check if the script is provided with a reliable signature.
2. The curl statement doesn't set any timeouts or retry strategies, leaving this function susceptible to hanging indefinitely. Appropriate timeouts and retry intervals need to be set.
3. It's a good practice to enclose the entire function logic within a try/catch block to ensure that the function fails gracefully in case of any unexpected issues.
4. For enhanced security, we recommend using HTTPS instead of HTTP while fetching any scripts or code.
5. It's advisable to standardize log messages and provide verbose and quiet command-line options to control stdout outputs. Generating logs can help in better tracking and debugging of code.
