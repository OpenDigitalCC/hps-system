Function signature: 36b4990e9b99b775a8e6be52ea2f3098da2a0dd4579130e4277b663f40451e06

### Function overview

The `osvc_apply_identity_from_hps` function specifies the identity for a node in a cluster by checking the agent nodename in the OpenSVC configuration file. If the nodename is not found, the function logs an error and terminates. If the daemon is not running, the function provides a debug log stating that the identity will be configured upon daemon startup. The function assigns a value to the `node.name` attribute if the agent nodename is "ips". It also attempts to assign a value to the `cluster.name` attribute from a cluster configuration file.

### Technical description

- **Name:** `osvc_apply_identity_from_hps`
- **Description:** This function assigns identities to a node and a cluster using values from configuration files.
- **Globals:** [ conf: A string storing the path to the OpenSVC configuration file ]
- **Arguments:** [ No command line arguments ]
- **Outputs:** Logs error, debug, and warning messages related to the process of assigning identities.
- **Returns:** 1 if the configuration file is unreadable or the agent nodename is not found; 0 otherwise.
- **Example usage:**
```bash
osvc_apply_identity_from_hps
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Ensure that the OpenSVC and cluster configuration files exist and are readable.
2. Handle other potential error situations, such as if the 'om' command (which checks the status of the cluster) fails or if the daemon is not running.
3. Consider parameterizing the function so that the paths to the configuration files can be specified at the command line.
4. Consider validating the cluster and node name to ensure they adhere to expected naming conventions, decreasing the likelihood of issues during later processes.
5. Be mindful of the system permissions required to run commands involving cluster status and name assignments. It's best practice to run these commands with the minimum privileges necessary to reduce the potential security risks.
