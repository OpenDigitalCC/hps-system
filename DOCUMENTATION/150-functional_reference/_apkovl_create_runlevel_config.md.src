### Function Overview

The function `_apkovl_create_runlevel_config` is used to create a directory for default runlevels at a given base directory. If the directory creation is successful, it enables local service in the created default runlevel by creating a symbolic link. The function also logs errors in directory creation and symbolic linking, if any, and returns 1 to indicate the errors. If no error is encountered, the function logs successful operation and returns 0.



### Technical description

**name:** `_apkovl_create_runlevel_config`

**description:** This function helps create a directory for default runlevels in a given base directory. It then enables local service in the created default runlevel. It also logs the outcomes of the directory creation, symlink operation and returns appropriate status code.

**globals:** None

**arguments:** 
- `$1: base_dir` - The base directory path where a new runlevels directory is to be created

**outputs:** Log messages indicating success or failure of directory creation and symlink operation for local service in default runlevel

**returns:** 
The function returns two possible exit codes:
- `0` on success
- `1` if it fails to create the directory or the symbolic link.

**Example usage:** 
```bash
_apkovl_create_runlevel_config "/path/to/base_dir"
```

### Quality and Security recommendations

1. Consider proper validation and sanitization of the base directory path before using it. This is to prevent directory traversal vulnerabilities where an attacker can specify paths outside the intended base directory.
2. It's crucial to handle errors appropriately. In this case, the function should not only log the error but consider providing a comprehensive report on why the error occurred if possible.
3. Validate whether the directory at `base_dir` and the local service directory `/etc/init.d/local` exist before creating symbolic links to avoid dangling symlinks.
4. Improve logging by including more context or even improving the logs to structured logging with key-value pairs for better traceability and debugging.
5. Ensure to run this function with minimal required privileges to prevent potential security threats. It's a security best practice to always use the principle of least privilege (PoLP).
