Contained in `lib/host-scripts.d/common.d/n_network_functions.sh`

Function signature: 7be6dc67621a499ff331c0f30e602bda79e77117b88d6451d7e8f309ae8e9dbc

### Function Overview

The function `n_show_vlan_interfaces` outputs information about the VLAN interfaces of a device. It begins by printing a heading "VLAN Interfaces:" and an underline. Next, it uses the `ip` command to iterate over each network interface that's using the VLAN protocol. It extracts and displays the following information for each qualifying interface: the interface's name, VLAN ID, IPv4 address, operational state, and the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size.

### Technical Description

```no-highlight
- Name: n_show_vlan_interfaces
- Description: Outputs a report of VLAN interface information.
- Globals: None
- Arguments:
  - No arguments are used in this function.
- Outputs:
  - A formatted list of VLAN interfaces is output to STDOUT, including their interface names, VLAN IDs, IP addresses, operational states, and MTU sizes.
- Returns:
  - Returns nothing as the function does not explicitly handle return values.
- Example Usage:
  Call the function simply with `n_show_vlan_interfaces`.
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Introduce input validation and error checking mechanisms to enhance robustness. Also, consider print error messages to STDERR instead of STDOUT.
2. Use `local -r` for variables that are not meant to be changed to enforce immutability and improve code safety.
3. Enclose all variable references in double quotes to prevent word-splitting and pathname expansion.
4. It's advisable to handle any potential errors that may occur when using `cat` command to read from system files. If these files cannot be read, the error messages should be appropriately handled.
5. Collect the script's dependencies (e.g., `ip`, `awk`, `cut`, `grep`) at the start of the script and notify the user if any are missing.
6. Consider hardening the function by employing a stricter globbing or regex match to ensure it only acts upon valid interface identifiers.
7. Given it's a public function, it's advisable to implement a general STDERR logging mechanism. If needed, switch between verbosity levels.
