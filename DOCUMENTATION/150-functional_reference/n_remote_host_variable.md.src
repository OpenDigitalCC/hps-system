### Function overview

This function, `n_remote_host_variable()`, is used for manipulating host variables remotely. The function accepts two parameters - `name` and `value` . If the `value` parameter is provided, it is a SET operation that sets the host variable to the specified value remotely. If the `value` parameter is not provided, it's a GET operation that fetches the value of the specified host variable. This function makes use of the `n_ips_command` to perform the SET and GET operations.

### Technical description

- **name:** `n_remote_host_variable()`
- **description:** This function manipulates host variables remotely. It performs a SET operation if given a name and value, otherwise it performs a GET operation.
- **globals:** 
  - `n_ips_command`: This holds the command to be executed to set or get the value of the specified host variable.
- **arguments:** 
  - `$1:` `name` of the host variable to be fetched or modified. This is a required argument.

  - For SET operation: `n_remote_host_variable hostname value123`
  - For GET operation: `n_remote_host_variable hostname`

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Implement error checking after the execution of the `n_ips_command` to ensure that the command was successful.
2. Use robust variable handling to ensure that names and values are properly escaped and sanitized, preventing potential injection issues.
3. Always document the permissions needed to run `n_ips_command` especially if it requires elevated privileges.
4. Consider providing more descriptive error messages in case of failure.
5. Implement logging to track when variables are changed or accessed which could be essential for debugging and audit trails.
