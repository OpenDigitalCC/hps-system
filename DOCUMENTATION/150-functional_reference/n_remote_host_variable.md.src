Function signature: 896a3615c634776e1eaefacae6700970fee7f2288b2227eb8e0ad2472d0ed015

### Function Overview
The function `n_remote_host_variable` provides capability to set and get host variables by name. If a value is provided, it sets the variable with the given name to the provided value (SET operation). If no value is given, the function retrieves the current value for the provided name (GET operation). The function utilizes the `n_ips_command` for these operations. If an error occurs while running the `n_ips_command`, it logs the error and returns the error code. If a GET operation is tried for a non-existing variable, a custom error code (4) is returned.

### Technical Description
- **name**: n_remote_host_variable
- **description**: The function is designed to set a specific host variable or get its value.
- **globals**: [N_IPS_COMMAND_LAST_ERROR: Stores the last error message returned by n_ips_command.]
- **arguments**: [$1: The name of the host variable to set or get, $2: The value to set the variable to for a set operation. This argument is ignored during a get operation.]
- **outputs**: outputs the current value of the variable, or any error messages.
- **returns**: Returns 0 on success, the error code from `n_ips_command` on failure, or custom error code 4 if the variable does not exist during a get operation.
- **example usage**:
    ```bash
    n_remote_host_variable "host_name" "localhost" # Sets variable host_name to localhost
    n_remote_host_variable "host_name" # Gets the current value of host_name
    ```

### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. In-depth error handling mechanisms should be considered for more precise error identification and troubleshooting.
2. User inputs should not contain special characters that could be interpreted by bash and potentially lead to command injection.
3. Robust null checks should be included to prevent possible null pointer operations.
4. Avoid storing sensitive data in global variables to enhance security.
5. Use encrypted communication channels to prevent digital eavesdropping when transferring data.
6. Ensure that appropriate file permissions are set if logged error messages are written to a file.
7. Regular updates and reviews of the codebase can additionally maintain the code quality and spot potential security risks.
