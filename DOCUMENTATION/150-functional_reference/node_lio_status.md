### Quality and security recommendations

1. It would be beneficial to make sure that the required commands (`systemctl` and `targetcli`) are available in the system before actually utilizing them in the function.
2. The command outputs might require interpretations which can be hieroglyphic or error-prone to a non-technical user. It might be advantageous to include added verbosity/reasoning to the echoed content for the sake of usability.
3. Remember to check the return values of the commands and handle any errors that might occur. Currently, the function always returns 0 irrespective of whether the commands run successfully or not.
4. It's good to utf-8 sanitize the output for proper display and to prevent possible injection attacks. This is especially crucial if the output is intended to be utilized or displayed elsewhere.
5. Always validate that the function is being run with the appropriate permissions since commands like `systemctl` and `targetcli` often require superuser rights.
