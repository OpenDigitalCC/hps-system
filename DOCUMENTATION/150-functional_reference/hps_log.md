### Function overview

The `hps_log` function is a custom log function that logs system events in a file named `hps-system.log` located in the directory specified by `HPS_LOG_DIR`. The function creates logs with timestamps and a log level which can be set from the command input. It also helps organize logs by supporting an identifier input. Lastly, if this function is called without the `HPS_LOG_IDENT` variable having been set, it defaults the identifier as 'hps'.

### Technical description

- **name**: hps_log
- **description**: This function logs data with the specified level, message, and identity into a file defined by environment variable `HPS_LOG_DIR`. Default identity is 'hps' when `HPS_LOG_IDENT` is not set.
- **globals**: [ HPS_LOG_DIR: Directory to store the log files, HPS_LOG_IDENT: Identity for the logs]
- **arguments**: [ $1: Log level, $... : Log message ]
- **outputs**: Writes logs to `hps-system.log` file in the location specified by `HPS_LOG_DIR`.
- **returns**: Not applicable since logging functions typically do not return a value.
- **example usage**: `hps_log "error" "This is a sample error message"`

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Protect the log file by setting appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized access or tampering.
2. Regularly rotate and archive log files to avoid them becoming too large.
3. Implement checks to ensure that `HPS_LOG_DIR` is set to a valid directory.
4. Provide error handling mechanisms if the log file cannot be written to.
5. Assign a default value to `HPS_LOG_DIR` that points to a secure and writeable directory if it has not been set.
6. Avoid logging sensitive information to maintain user data privacy.
