Contained in `lib/functions.d/node-bootstrap-functions.sh`

Function signature: 543df559d5361b6ff63bc8c3c20c0306372fc967990130e0d1e6d0c41d383b2f

### Function Overview

The function `hps_node_init()` is primarily used for initializing nodes within a system. It first runs the `hps_load_node_functions` to load the necessary node functions. If successful, it checks for the presence of the function `n_queue_run` and executes it if available. In the case where `n_queue_run` functions is not found, it outputs a warning message.

### Technical Description

- Name: `hps_node_init`
- Description: This function is intended to initialize nodes. It first loads node functions then runs a command for initialization if available.
- Globals: None
- Arguments: None
- Outputs: If `n_queue_run` is not present, a warning is printed to the Standard Error.
- Returns: The status code of running `hps_load_node_functions` or None if no error occurred.
- Example usage:

```bash
hps_node_init()
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Ensure that functions `hps_load_node_functions` and `n_queue_run` are securely implemented and do not contain potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
2. Based on the current implementation, `hps_node_init` function doesn't have any arguments. If your future implementation considers adding arguments, do proper argument validation to prevent potential threats.
3. Proper error handling: Currently if `n_queue_run` doesn't exist, the script only prints out a warning message but continues execution. Depending on the context, this might not be the desired behavior. Consider termination (exit) or exception handling for critical function calls.
4. Ensure that the bash scripts are given only the necessary privileges required to perform their intended actions, not more, to limit potential exploitation of the privileges.
5. Finally, consider regular security audits of the code to detect and mitigate any potential security vulnerabilities.
