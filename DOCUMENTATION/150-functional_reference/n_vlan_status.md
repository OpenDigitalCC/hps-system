### Function Overview

The `n_vlan_status()` function in Bash fetches various pieces of information about a given VLAN interface (Virtual Local Area Network interface) within a Linux system. More specifically, it fetches the VLAN ID, IP addresses, operational state, and MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) size if the particular interface exists on the system.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Add error handling for command execution.
2. Consider using command-line arguments to specify which pieces of information to print.
3. Use absolute paths of commands for security and to avoid using maliciously altered user paths.
4. Use a stricter check for interface presence that includes checking interface types.
5. Build functionality to handle multiple interfaces at once instead of calling the function multiple times.
6. Refrain from printing sensitive information like IP addresses or VLAN IDs onto unsecured locations or logs.
7. Make sure any privilege escalation required to access certain pieces of information is appropriately handled to prevent security issues.
