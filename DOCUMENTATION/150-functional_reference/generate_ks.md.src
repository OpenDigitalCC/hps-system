Function signature: 910fa3a19c946bd39c8eca822d70f1cb6e78c3b1080f83bc731451ec74c98b0f

### Function Overview
The `generate_ks` function is primarily designed to support the creation and configuration of a host kickstart for a specified `macid` and `HOST_TYPE`. It retrieves and exports essential variables such as `HOST_IP`, `HOST_NETMASK`, `HOST_NAME`, `HOST_GATEWAY`, `HOST_DNS`, `HOST_TEMPLATE_DIR`, `INSTALLER_TYPE`, `HOST_INSTALL_SCRIPT`, and `HOST_INSTALL_FUNC`. This function also sets the host's state to "INSTALLING" and presents the script offered.

### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. Add validations for the inputs (`macid`, `HOST_TYPE`) to ensure they meet the expected requirements.
2. Include error handling to manage when expected globals or host configuration details are missing.
3. Commented sections of the code need to be cleaned up or well-documented to explain why they are there and what potential future use they could have.
4. Ensure that returned logs do not reveal too much information that could compromise the security of the system.
5. The script rendering template might need sanitizing to avoid executing harmful commands.
