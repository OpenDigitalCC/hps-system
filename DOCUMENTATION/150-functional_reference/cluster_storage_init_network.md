Contained in `lib/functions.d/cluster-functions.sh`

Function signature: a26587720047888528793a67b36d48651fe7668e31b2136db1f521752f8ebd7d

### Function overview

The `cluster_storage_init_network` function sets up the initial configuration of a network for a cluster storage. It retrieves the number of storage networks to be configured, validates inputs, and then sets the configurations accordingly. It repeats the process for every storage network configured. It mainly obtains configuration parameters through command line prompts for user input, and logs errors and information to a system log. 

### Technical description

- **Name**: cluster_storage_init_network
- **Description**: Initializes and configures the settings of the storage network for a cluster.
- **Globals**: cluster_domain (Contains the domain name of the cluster)
- **Arguments**: None.
- **Outputs**: Logs of errors and informational messages regarding the achieved or failed configuration of storage networks.
- **Returns**:   
    0 - If the function completes successfully   
    1 - If an error occurs (such as missing cluster domain or invalid subnet base).
- **Example Usage**: 
```bash
cluster_storage_init_network
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Avoid relying on a prompt-based system for configuration. This is prone to human error. Instead, use configuration files or automation scripts.
2. Validate all command-line arguments and network details to prevent malformed inputs.
3. It's good practice to separate the functions for fetching, verifying and setting each network parameter for better modularization.
4. It's important to log all errors, warnings, and information for troubleshooting and debugging purposes. However, make sure sensitive information (like IP addresses or domain names) isn't exposed in a readable format.
5. Implement appropriate error handling to ensure the function fails gracefully when problems occur.
6. Consider using a more robust system for managing global variables instead of bash local variables to increase data safety and decrease misuse.
