### Function Overview

The `osvc_bootstrap_cluster_on_ips` function acts as a procedure for initializing an OpenSVC cluster within an IPS (Internet Protocol Suite) environment. This function involves several steps including:

1. Configuration generation and enforcing the key.
2. Starting up a daemon with the aid of supervisord.
3. Then undertaking further configuration steps with regards to the cluster,
4. Including the setup of a heartbeat.
5. Generation and/or retrieval of the cluster secret.
6. Ultimately resulting in the verification of the daemon.

### Technical Description

- **Function Name**: `osvc_bootstrap_cluster_on_ips`
- **Description**: This function bootstraps an OpenSVC cluster on IPS (Internet Protocol Suite). It performs several steps such as generating a configuration, starting a daemon, setting up cluster settings, and verifying the daemon.
- **Globals**: 
  - `CLUSTER_SERVICES_DIR`: Directory containing services for the cluster.
  - `cluster_name`: Name of the cluster.
  - `cluster_secret`: Secret passphrase for the cluster.
- **Arguments**: This function does not accept any arguments.
- **Outputs**: This function logs either the success or the failure of each step and prints these messages to the standard output.
- **Returns**: 0 on successful execution, 1 on failure due to configuration issues or failure to set parameters, and 2 on failure due to daemon start issues or the daemon not responding after bootstrapping.
- **Example Usage**: 

           osvc_bootstrap_cluster_on_ips

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Strict handling of the `cluster_secret`: The cluster secret should be securely stored and its read access should be tightly controlled. Logging the secret value should also be avoided.
2. Exception handling: The function should robustly handle any exceptions or failures that may occur during execution especially during critical actions such as creating configurations and starting daemons.
3. Function validation: Additional validation checks could be included to ensure the function is executing in the expected environment that complies with other necessary specifications.
4. Logging: Including more logs in the function would help tracking the progress and tracing any failures more easily.
5. Secure daemon: Ensure that the "om daemon run" command runs securely, especially when exposing IP addresses and other sensitive details.
