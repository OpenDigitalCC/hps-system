### Function Overview

The Bash function `int_to_ip` is designed to convert an integer to its corresponding 32-bit IPv4 address format (e.g., `192.168.0.1`). It accepts an integer as an argument, performs bit shift operations and bitwise AND with 255 on this integer in order to separate out four octets that make up an IPv4 address, and then echoes the result in the format of a standard dotted-notation IP address.

### Technical Description

- **Name**: `int_to_ip`
- **Description**: Converts a given integer value to its equivalent IP address in 32-bit IPv4 format.
- **Globals**: None
- **Arguments**:
  - `$1`: The input integer to be converted to IPv4 address format.
- **Outputs**:
  - The calculated IP address in 32-bit IPv4 format is echoed to stdout.
- **Returns**:
  - The function will always return `0` to indicate successful execution. Errors are not covered in this function.
- **Example Usage**:
  - `int_to_ip 3232235776` will echo `192.168.1.0` to stdout.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. **Error Handling**: As a good practice, this function should also handle error situations such as incorrect input types and out-of-range input values. These checks can be added at the beginning of the function.
2. **Input Validation**: Validate the input to ensure that it is a positive numeric value and falls within the valid range for a 32bit IP address.
3. **Return Codes**: Make use of different return codes to indicate different kinds of issues (e.g., invalid input, error while converting), this would help the calling function understand if there were any issues during execution.
4. **Commenting**: Include more comments throughout the function to ensure maintainability and comprehension for other developers.
5. **Consistent Coding Style**: Make sure there is consistency in the use of quotations and other coding elements within the function, following the best practices and guidelines for Bash scripting. This will help in maintaining the readability of the code.
6. **Security**: Consider the security implications, always sanitize and validate the input parameters to prevent potential code injection attacks.
