### Technical description

- **Name:** `_log`

- **Description:** This function performs logging operations to both a remote log and the system console (if `LOG_ECHO` environment variable is set to 1). It is specifically designed for logging operations regarding the creation of ZFS pools on free disks.

- **Globals:** [ `LOG_ECHO`: An environmental variable used to control if the logging output should also be printed to console. ]

- **Arguments:** [ `$*`: A variable-length list of arguments to be logged. These arguments are usually messages related to the operations performed in the ZFS pool creation process. ]

- **Outputs:** Printed statements are sent to the console (if `LOG_ECHO` is set to 1) and the `remote_log` function.

- **Returns:** Nothing directly, but it outputs strings to the console and the remote logging service.

- **Example Usage:**
    ```
    LOG_ECHO=1 _log "ZFS pool created successfully"
    ```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Always sanitize the inputs before logging to prevent log injection attacks.

2. Ensure that the `remote_log` function correctly handles connection failures and other errors to prevent disruption of the main program.

3. Consider adding timestamp and log level (info, warning, error, etc.) information to the log messages to provide better logging context.

4. Regularly rotate and archive logs to prevent them from occupying too much disk space.

5. Encrypt sensitive data in logs to protect them from being exposed to unauthorized users.

6. Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent DOS attacks via rapid, repeated calls to the `_log` function.
