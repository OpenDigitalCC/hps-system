Function signature: 31afa0803d6c2379fb602dea003ab030c79840eb8d4986055f54e13b7edef237

### Function Overview

The function `n_network_select_storage_interface()` in bash scripting is designed to facilitate the selection of the best network interface for a storage system. Initially, it attempts to find an interface that meets a speed of at least 10G. If this process fails or no such interface exists, it resorts to another function call to identify any interface, regardless of speed. The function evaluates the presence of the selected interface and ensures it is free from unnecessary whitespace before it returns it.

### Technical Description

- **Name**: `n_network_select_storage_interface`
- **Description**: This bash function identifies and chooses the optimal network interface for a given system. It primarily seeks interfaces with bandwidth capacities of 10G or above. Should these not exist, it's flexible enough to resort to any available interface.
- **Globals**: None
- **Arguments**: None
- **Outputs**: Clean (whitespace-free) optimal network interface name
- **Returns**: 0 if the selection process was successful; 1 otherwise.
- **Example Usage**: To run this function, simply call it as `n_network_select_storage_interface` within your bash script. The optimal network interface will be printed to the terminal.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. This function leans heavily on the notion that higher speeds are inherently desirable. While this is often true, distinct scenarios may require interfaces with different characteristics. Therefore, customizability might boost the function's efficacy.
   
2. Currently, the function lacks error handling mechanisms in the event of a failed interface selection. Adding these mechanisms may boost security.

3. To further enhance this function's security, consider validating the returned interface name before use.

4. As the function is very specific, its reusability might be quite narrow. Broadening its purpose could increase its effective applicability. 

5. Make sure you have proper permissions to call this function since it handles system network interfaces. It can violate security principles if used inappropriately.
