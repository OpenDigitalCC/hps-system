Function signature: eb0d9b3cde2db7f28ef70b36d8d6c4d6407f51ef1ca999daff92c5de88823f30

### Function Overview

The `_extract_apk_version` function takes a filename and a package name as inputs. Its primary objective is to effectively retrieve the version of the APK file. The function accomplishes this by processing the filename, removing the package name prefix and the `.apk` extension. The resultant output is the version of the apk file.

### Technical Description

- **Name**: `_extract_apk_version`
- **Description**: This function extracts the version of an apk file. It removes the package name prefix and the `.apk` suffix from its input filename and then echoes the version.
- **Globals**: None.
- **Arguments**: The function takes two arguments:
    * `$1: filename` - The filename of the apk from which the version is to be extracted.
    * `$2: pkg_name` - The name of the package associated with the apk file.
- **Outputs**: The function echoes the version of the apk file.
- **Returns**: None.
- **Example Usage**: `_extract_apk_version myApp-1.0.0.apk myApp` would return `1.0.0`.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Ensure that the filename and pkg_name inputs are sanitized and validated before passing them into the function to prevent possible code injections or errors.
2. Adding error handling for scenarios where the version extraction operation fails might improve function robustness.
3. Incorporate a logging mechanism to trace any issues arising from the process.
4. It might be beneficial to include functionality that verifies the existence and validity of an APK file directly within the function itself.
5. When running in a production environment, it's recommended to restrict who can run this function to prevent misuse.
