Contained in `lib/host-scripts.d/rocky.d/rocky.sh`

Function signature: c64e26c5e886b1a0aded061414c66873630e97cae41cf2c7a37f800fd6866674

### Function overview

The `build_zfs_source()` function is responsible for retrieving, building and installing ZFS from a source file for the Rocky Linux distribution. The function first fetches an index of the available source files from a local server and identifies the required source file to build ZFS. If the file is found, it is downloaded and extracted to a local directory. The function then installs the necessary dependencies and builds ZFS from the source file. If all steps are successful, the function checks if the ZFS module is available.

### Technical description

- Name: `build_zfs_source`
- Description: The function retrieves the ZFS source file from a local server, extracts the source, builds and installs ZFS. It log messages throughout the process to inform about the progress and potential errors.
- Globals: None
- Arguments: None
- Outputs: Logs messages about the progress of the function. It includes the start of the function, fetching the source index, downloading the source file, installing dependencies, extracting and building ZFS from source, checking the ZFS module and successful completion of the function.
- Returns: 1 if any process in the function fails (downloading source index, finding the source file in the index, downloading the source file, installing dependencies, extracting the archive, building and installing ZFS, finding the ZFS module after installation), 0 if the function runs successfully.
- Example usage:
```shell
build_zfs_source
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Use secure communication protocols (such as HTTPS) while fetching the source index and downloading the source file to prevent potential man-in-the-middle attacks.
2. Add validity checks for the downloaded source files and the extracted directories to ensure the integrity of the files.
3. Use specific versions for dependencies to ensure consistent environment for the build process.
4. Check return values of the functions and log appropriate messages for improved debugging.
5. Remove temporary files at the end of the function regardless of the function execution result for better cleanup.
6. Wrap the entire function within a try-catch block to handle unexpected errors effectively.
