### Function overview

The provided function, `build_zfs_source()`, is designed to build the ZFS source for Rocky. This function fetches the source index, downloads the required source file, installs dependencies, extracts and builds ZFS from the source file, installs the build, and checks the installed ZFS module. If any step fails, the function logs the relevant error message and exits with a return value of `1`. If ZFS is successfully built and installed, the function logs a success message and exits with a return value of `0`.

### Technical description

- name: `build_zfs_source()`
- description: This is a Bash function that gets the source index for building ZFS from a specified URL, downloads the source file based on that index, verifies the downloaded source file, installs the necessary resources using dnf, extracts and builds from the source file, installs the build, and checks the installed module.
- globals: [ `gateway`, `src_base_url`, `index_url`, `build_dir`, `index_file`, `src_file`, `src_url`, `src_archive` ]
- arguments: None
- outputs: The function logs various success and error messages at various stages of the build, such as downloading resources, fetching the source index, installing dependencies, and more.
- returns: `0` if the build is successful. `1` if the build fails at any point.
- example usage: `build_zfs_source`

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Check for the existence of the necessary commands (like `curl`, `wget`, etc.) before running the function to prevent the execution from halting midway.
2. Validate and sanitize input to the function to defend against command injection attacks.
3. Consider setting explicit error codes instead of simply returning `1` to identify at which step the function fails.
4. Refactor the function to separate concerns. Each task should ideally be handled by a separate function, improving maintainability, readability, and making it easier to handle errors by each function.
5. Some data might be confidential or sensitive, add checks to not print such data to the logs unmasked.
