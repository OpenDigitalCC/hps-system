### Function Overview

The `storage_provision_volume()` function is designed to automate the process of provisioning a storage volume within a networked storage solution. The function accepts three parameters to define the fully qualified iSCSI Qualified Name (IQN), the storage capacity, and the zvol name of the volume to be created. The function then creates an iSCSI target, or storage resource, that other iSCSI initiators on the network can access.

### Technical Description

***storage_provision_volume()***

- **Description:** Provisions a storage volume within a networked storage solution by creating an iSCSI target.
- **Globals:**
  - `host_type`: checks to verify this is a storage host.
  - `zpool`: gets local zpool name.
- **Arguments:** 
  - `--iqn` (`$2`): The IQN of the iSCSI.
  - `--capacity` (`$2`): Storage size requirement in appropriate units (Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte, or Gigabyte).
  - `--zvol-name` (`$2`): The name of the volume to be created.
- **Outputs:** 
    - Validates required parameters.
    - Verifies that this is a storage host.
    - Calculates and reports available space, ensuring enough space exists for the requested volume.
- **Returns:** 
  - `1` if an error occurs, such as missing required parameters, incorrect host type, running out of available space, or failure in creating zvol or iSCSI target.
  - `0` if the volume is successfully provisioned.
- **Example usage:** 

```bash
storage_provision_volume --iqn iqn.2021-05.com.example:storage:disk1 --capacity 1G --zvol-name disk1
```

### Quality and Security recommendations

1. The function should check the validity of the passed arguements which includes checking if the `iqn` and `zvol-name` are properly formatted and if the capacity is realistically feasible before attempting to provision the storage volume.
2. It may be beneficial to have an additional parameter to choose the type of volume to be provisioned—block, file or object—to add versatility to the function.
3. This function could further be improved by providing a rollback mechanism for partial completions, in case the storage provisioning operation fails midway.
4. Always ensure that error messages do not disclose too much information, which might end up being a security risk. For instance, revealing the host type or zpool name could provide useful information to malicious users.
5. To reduce the risk of injection vulnerabilities, ensure that all parameters within the shell command are appropriately escaped or quoted.
6. For a more robust implementation, consider using a try-catch mechanism to handle unexpected errors. This will prevent the script from crashing and provide a more elegant way of logging the error.
