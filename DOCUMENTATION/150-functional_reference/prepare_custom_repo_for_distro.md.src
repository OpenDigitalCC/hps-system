Function signature: f41fadc94c0ebb53ebb87776324ccfcc73903f665dfe9bfd0a9d3f4c9cbb827c

### Function Overview
The function `prepare_custom_repo_for_distro` serves to prepare a custom software repository for a given linux distribution represented by the input `dist_string`. It also takes an array of URLs or local files to download and add to the custom repository. The function segregates URLs and local file paths from the other entries stamped as required packages in an iterative manner. Further, it initiates repository creation, downloads the package from each URL or copies from local files, and builds the YUM repository. It verifies that the required packages are available in the repository and logs an error if a package is missing.

### Technical Description

- **Name**: prepare_custom_repo_for_distro
- **Description**: This function prepares a custom software repository for a given distribution by segregating source links (URLs or local file paths) from required package listings, creating repositories, building YUM repository, and ensuring presence of required packages.
- **Globals**: *HPS_PACKAGES_DIR*: The root directory where repositories are created.
- **Arguments**: 
   - `$1`: `dist_string`, the string representation of a Linux distribution.
   - `$@`: An array of URLs, local file paths to the required packages or names of the required packages.
- **Outputs**: Logs various informational and error messages during repository preparation. Copies or downloads package files to the repository.
- **Returns**: The function uses return values varying from 0-6 to indicate success or various types of failures (such as, failure to create repository directory, download or copy a package, etc.).
- **Example usage**: `prepare_custom_repo_for_distro "ubuntu" "https://example.com/package1.deb" "package2" "/path/to/package3.deb"`

### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. **Error Handling**: At present, the function returns error messages in various places but a more rigorous error handling system should be implemented for each step.
2. **Input Validation**: Currently, the repository name and the package sources are not validated. They should be confirmed to avoid unpredictable behavior.
3. **User Permissions**: Permissions required to create directories or copy files need careful considerations. 
4. **Logging & Auditing**: It would be good to maintain consistent logging throughout the function to account for all actions taken.
5. **Dependency Handling**: The function should manage potential dependencies of the required packages.
6. **Use Secure Communication**: If possible, use secure protocols (like HTTPS) for downloading packages from URLs.
