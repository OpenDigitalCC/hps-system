Function signature: 973863ced9e380918f2a6cfb0d3cb925aab9f7171b50b1c0b6920877dcdb4010

### Function Overview

The `n_display_info_before_prompt()` function is used predominantly to display node information on the console before the prompt. This function first checks if the console is enabled or disabled. If the console is disabled, it simply logs the information and returns. If the console is enabled, it proceeds to ensure the `n_node_information` command is available before executing further commands. Then, it creates an issue file that displays before logging in and ensures it's readable. Finally, the function displays the issue file immediately on the console and logs the creation of the issue file with node info. The function returns 0 indicating successful execution.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Although the function is encapsulated to avoid global variables, it uses a lot of system commands which may not be safe from all forms of shell-injection attacks. It is recommended to use safer forms of commands or sanitize user input.
2. Robust error handling is not present. It is recommended to add more condition-based returns for errors and implement broader exceptions.
3. While the function checks whether certain commands exist before trying to run them, there is no fallback method if these commands are not available.
4. Function lacks explicit commenting on various sections, making it hard to understand for newer developers.
5. The function could be modularized further for code clarity and function reusability. For instance, separate functions for checking if the console is disabled and creating the issue file could be beneficial.
