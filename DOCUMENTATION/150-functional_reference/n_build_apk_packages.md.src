### Function overview

The function `n_build_apk_packages` is used to build APK packages for *OpenSVC server* and *OpenSVC client* extensions. It first checks for required environment variables, verifies if the package directories exist and then continues with building the server and client packages respectively. Upon successful build, the function locates these packages and reports their metadata - providing their size and location. Lastly, the packages are copied into the HPS packages directory.

### Technical description

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Error messages could be sent to stderr rather than stdout to improve the separation of regular and error output.
2. Permission checks for critical files and directories should be added - The script doesn't check if it has write permission to the target directories.
3. Consider enhancing error handling - The script carries on with the build process even if the checksum generation fails.
4. The function calls 'cd' repeatedly, which can fail. If it does, subsequent parts of the script can have unintended effects.
5. Use more robust methods for changing directories such as `pushd` and `popd`.
6. Always double-quote your shell variable expansions to prevent word-splitting and pathname-expansion.
7. Using `eval` can pose a potential security risk. Consider alternative ways to obtain the desired information.
8. Add more granularity to return codes so that different errors return different codes. This can make debugging easier.
