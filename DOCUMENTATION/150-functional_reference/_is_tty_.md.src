Function signature: 53fbf6cc003bc7d9b4614fc9d372f3471ed01447874f4db99da2816eb3cb7e69

### Function Overview 

The function `_is_tty()` is a utility function that checks if the standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout), or standard error (stderr) of the current process is connected to a terminal. The function uses the `-t` test to determine if each file descriptor (0, 1, and 2) corresponds to a terminal. It returns a boolean value, with `true` indicating that at least one file descriptor is connected to a terminal, and `false` indicating that none are.

### Technical Description

Here is a block definition for pandoc:

  echo "Not running in a terminal"
fi
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Add a function comment that summarizes what the function does. This makes it easier for others to understand the function's behavior without having to read through its code.
2. Secure the function against potential vulnerabilities or bugs by adding error handling and validation checks as necessary.
3. Audit the use of this function in larger scripts, especially those that handle sensitive information. The function checks whether input/output is connected to a terminal, which might be an important security consideration in certain contexts.
4. Continually review and update the function as necessary to reflect current best practices and accommodate changes in the system environment or the Bash shell itself.
