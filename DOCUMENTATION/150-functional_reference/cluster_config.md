### Function overview

The Bash function `cluster_config()` provides an interface to manage the configuration of a cluster. The function takes three arguments: an operation, a key, and optionally a value. The operation can be 'get', 'set', 'exists', or any other string (which will be treated as an error). The function attempts to find the active cluster configuration file. If it doesn't find one, it returns an error. If it does find one, it performs the desired operation on the key-value pair.

### Technical description

- **Name**: `cluster_config`
- **Description**: A Bash function to manage the key-value pairs in the configuration of an active cluster.
- **Globals**: `[ cluster_file: a file containing the active cluster configuration ]`
- **Arguments**: `[ $1: operation to perform (get, set, exists), $2: a key to operate on, $3(Optional): a value corresponding to the key ]`
- **Outputs**: Outputs depend on operation. If 'get', it prints the value corresponding to the key. If 'set', it modifies or creates a key-value pair. If 'exists', it searches for the key. Any other string will result in an error message.
- **Returns**: 1 if no active cluster config is found, 2 if an unknown operation is passed to the function.
- **Example usage**: To set the value of a key 'key1' in the active cluster's config to 'value1', command will look like `cluster_config set key1 value1`.

### Quality and security recommendations

1. The function currently writes error messages to stderr, which is a good practice. However, no positive messages are provided for successful operations. Providing feedback for success can improve usability and debuggability.
2. The 'set' operation makes use of `echo` to append to a file, which can be unsafe if the script does not control the content being echoed. A safer alternative would be to use `printf`.
3. The 'get' operation uses cut and grep to parse the key-value pairs. If the values contain special characters, or if another '=' appears in the line, this could have unintended consequences. A more robust parsing mechanism could improve this.
4. The function may consider input validation to ensure that provided keys and values are valid before attempting operations.
5. It could be beneficial to check if the operation succeeded (i.e., the value was actually set or got), and return appropriate errors if not.
