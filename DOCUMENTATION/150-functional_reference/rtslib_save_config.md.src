Function signature: ac265647656df50229187ef098655cc149e59be37bf19e8244f9356fddcace3e

### Function Overview

The `rtslib_save_config` function creates a Python3 child process and runs an inline (heredoc) Python script. This script imports the `RTSRoot` class from the `rtslib_fb` module and calls the `save_to_file()` method on an instance of that class. Therefore, using this function writes the current state of the runtime configuration of the target (presumably a storage target/subsystem) to the configuration file.

### Technical Description

- **Name**: `rtslib_save_config`
- **Description**: The function calls a Python3 subprocess, importing the `RTSRoot` class from the `rtslib_fb` module within the Python environment. It then invokes the `save_to_file` function of a `RTSRoot` class instance, thus saving the current state of the target's runtime settings into a file.
- **Globals**: None.
- **Arguments**: None.
- **Outputs**: Writes the target's current runtime settings into a file.
- **Returns**: None. If the Python subprocess encounters an error, it will be written to stderr.
- **Example Usage**:

         rtslib_save_config()

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Ensure proper exception handling is done. While using the Python code, if there is any exception caused due to environment issues or some runtime exceptions, this script would fail. So, appropriate error handling will make the function more robust.
2. Validate Python version: Although the script specifically asks for Python3, there may be differences between minor versions. It's always a good idea to make sure the right version of Python is available.
3. Document the "rtslib_fb" module and its usage: If the person using this function isn't familiar with the "rtslib_fb" module being imported, they could incorrectly use or modify this function. A brief explanation of the module and its usage would be helpful.
4. Use a more secure way to call Python scripts: While Bash is a flexible language, it also can have security implications when running scripts. Always consider the security of your Python scripts when using them in a Bash environment.
