### Function Overview

This function `get_latest_alpine_version()` is designed to fetch the latest version number of Alpine Linux from the official Alpine website. It uses either `curl` or `wget` to download the page, extracts the version number using a regular expression and sorting, and falls back to a predefined version number if it fails. If the extraction fails, the function provides a warning log message with the fallback version. Finally, the function returns this version number.

### Technical Description
For the function `get_latest_alpine_version()`:

**Name**: get_latest_alpine_version

**Description**: This function fetches the most recent version number of Alpine Linux from its official website using either `curl` or `wget` for the process. If the methods fail in fetching, the function resorts to a fallback version defined within it. The function provides a warning log message with the fallback version in case the extraction fails and finally returns the version number.

**Globals**: None

**Arguments**: None

**Outputs**: 
	- The version number of the latest Alpine Linux.
	- Warning message in case of failure fetching with the version falling back to 3.20.2

**Returns**:
	- 0 if the function is successful
	- Warning message with fallback version if the function fails

**Example Usage**:
Run the function like so:
`get_latest_alpine_version`

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Error handling can be better: Currently, the function falls back to a hard-coded version when it fails to fetch the latest version via `curl` or `wget`. However, the reason might be transient network issues, and a simple retry might work. Implementing a retry mechanism with exponential backoff would improve the quality of this script.
2. Robustness: Consider checking the returned status codes of the `curl` or `wget` commands, to know if the fetch was successful or not. The result does not always indicate the command's success.
3. For security reasons, consider using a more secure protocol like secure https to access the website compared to http which is currently in use. It can protect the data being exchanged from lurking security threats.
4. The function logs a warning message if it fails to get the versions, it can also provide some debugging information like the status code, error messages, etc., which could be helpful while troubleshooting.
5. The function could have a mechanism to periodically check for an update after some interval automatically so that the fetched version is always current without the need to invoke the function manually.
