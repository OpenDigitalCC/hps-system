Contained in `lib/host-scripts.d/common.d/common.sh`

Function signature: d808c9948262b9c10e2d29dbf91fff37d9e5c1ad4ce5c78af73813e01521b322

### Function overview

This Bash function, `remote_host_variable`, is designed to interact with a remote host's boot manager. The function sets a local variable for the name, and optionally for the value. The gateway is set to the function call of 'get_provisioning_node'. If an error is found, the function will immediately return with a status of 1. 

If a second argument is provided, it is encoded and added to the URL along with the encoded name. A POST request is made to this URL, which presumably interacts with the remote host, potentially setting a variable or performing some other change.

### Technical description

- Name: `remote_host_variable`
- Description: This function performs an HTTP POST request to a remote boot manager, potentially setting a variable.
- Globals: None
- Arguments: [`$1`: This is the name of the variable to be set or changed, a mandatory input. `$2`: This is the optional value of the variable.]
- Outputs: Outputs are dependent on the return of the `curl` call.
- Returns: If the `get_provisioning_node` function call encounters an error, the function returns 1. Otherwise, return value is determined by the `curl` request.
- Example usage: `remote_host_variable "NAME" "VALUE"`

### Quality and security recommendations

1. This function relies on a successful return from 'get_provisioning_node', but does not validate its output in any way. You should add a check to ensure that 'get_provisioning_node' returns a valid result.
2. There is a potential risk of URL injection with the `$2` argument. Ensure the validation and sanitization of the `$2` and `$1` parameter, especially if using this function in web applications or other programs where user input might be used as these arguments.
3. Rather than forming your URL by concatenation, consider using an URL-building library function for a more robust and error-resistant approach.
4. Always ensure that the correct headers are used in your curl requests to ensure authenticity and data integrity when communicating with the remote server.
5. The URL base-string used in the function is hardcoded into the code itself, consider moving it out to a configuration file or argument to make the script more versatile.
6. Consider using HTTPS for secure communication instead of HTTP.
