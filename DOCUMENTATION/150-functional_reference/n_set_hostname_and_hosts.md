Function signature: 5c49cc42685037b094c5b80248bbc1340247e3fb87f6b196b2249a61f999550f

### Function Overview
The function `n_set_hostname_and_hosts` is a shell script utility to automate the process of setting the hostname and configuring the hosts file in a linux environment. It fetches the configuration values like hostname, domain, and IP from the function `n_remote_host_variable` and `n_remote_cluster_variable`. It sets the hostname using available methods (via hostnamectl or hostname command). It also creates or updates the file `/etc/hosts` with the appropriate hostname and IP entries.

### Technical Description
- **Name:** `n_set_hostname_and_hosts`
- **Description:** This function sets the hostname, and updates the `/etc/hosts` file in a linux environment.
- **Globals:** None
- **Arguments:** No direct arguments, but uses outputs from `n_remote_host_variable` and `n_remote_cluster_variable` functions.
- **Outputs:** Messages to stdout, writes to /etc/hostname, /etc/hosts and logs via `n_remote_log`.
- **Returns:** Returns 1 if configuration fetch or validation fails, 2 if hostname change fails, 3 if /etc/hosts creation fails, and 0 on successful execution and completion.
- **Example usage:**

    ```bash
    n_set_hostname_and_hosts
    ```

### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. Security: Restrict the permissions of this script to trusted users only in order to prevent unauthorized modifications of host configuration.
2. Robustness: Error handling seems to be in place for most of the function calls, further improvements can be made by having a catch-all error trap.
3. Validation: Additional validations can be added for the hostname, domain and IP values (like length, characters, format, etc.).
4. Advances: The function can be updated to handle more network configurations and to work on more types of Linux distributions, especially those that may not follow these conventions directly.
5. Logging: Error logs could include more specific details about which step or validation caused the error for easier troubleshooting.
6. Code-Reuse: The parts of the code for hostname settings and hosts file configuration, could be further broken down into more modular, re-usable functions.
