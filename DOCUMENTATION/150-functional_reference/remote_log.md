Function signature: 1f586056ba1b573eed69d32639c3940c1c742ba73af4aae917a1d65d36c5367c

### Function overview

The `remote_log()` function is created to send log messages from a local machine to a remote gateway server. The function takes one argument, which is the message that needs to be logged. Before the message is sent, it is URL-encoded to ensure that it is correctly received by the remote server. The encoding is done in a loop, character by character. After the encoding, the message is sent to the remote server using a `curl` HTTP POST request.

### Technical description

Name:
- `remote_log()`

Description:
- This is a Bash function created to send log messages from a local machine to a remote gateway server. It takes one argument, the `message`, which needs to be logged. The function first URL-encodes the message and then sends it to the remote server via a POST request using `curl`.

Globals:
- `VAR`: Not applicable
- `macid`: The Mac id of the local machine
- `HOST_GATEWAY`: The IP address or URL of the remote server

Arguments:
- `$1`: The initial message that needs to be logged

Outputs:
- Sends an HTTP POST request to the remote server with the URL-encoded message

Returns:
- Null

Example Usage:
```bash
remote_log "This is a test log message"
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Input validation: Ensure that the variable `message` does not contain malicious commands or SQL injections.
2. Error handling: Handle exceptions to avoid function crashes e.g., if the remote server URL is incorrect or unreachable.
3. Logging: Include more logging within the function for debugging purposes.
4. Encryption: Consider encrypting the message content for confidentiality and data integrity.
5. Immutable globals: Since `macid` and `HOST_GATEWAY` are used as globals, careful handling is necessary as their value shouldn't be easily manipulated.
