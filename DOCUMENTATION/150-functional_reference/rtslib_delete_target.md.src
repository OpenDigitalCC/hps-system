### Function Overview
The Bash function `rtslib_delete_target()` is designed to delete a specific target on a remote host with the help of an iSCN (iSCSI Qualified Name). This function takes a remote host as an argument and generates an iSCN with the remote host embedded in it. Later, it uses python3 to implement the SCSI protocols with the help of the rtslib library for Python, deletes the required target, and saves the updated configuration to a file. If the target doesn't exist, it will print a message saying the target is not found. 

### Technical Description
- **Name**: rtslib_delete_target
- **Description**: This function deletes an ISCSI target provided by the remote host. It will print a confirmation message if the deletion is successful or a fail message in case the target is not found.
- **Globals**: 
  - [ VAR: iqn ] : It describes the iSCSI qualified name dynamically generated using the current year and month, appending the remote host name provided. It helps as the unique identifier for identifying the iSCSI targets.
- **Arguments**: 
  - [ $1: remote_host ]: The remote host from which the target needs to be deleted.
- **Outputs**: Prints a confirmation message indicating whether the deletion action was successful. It either shows a checkmark with 'Target deleted' or a cross sign with 'Target not found'.
- **Returns**: Nothing.
- **Example usage**: `rtslib_delete_target my_remote_host`

### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. Ensure that the remote host's input is correctly sanitized to avoid code injection or other kinds of security issues.
2. The function should have an error handling mechanism for scenarios where the Python code fails to execute.
3. Although the script currently handles targets not found gracefully, it could be further improved to provide more specific error messages.
4. It is essential to have permission checks so that unauthorized users cannot delete targets.
5. Ensure that date command used to generate iqn is correctly referenced in terms of the timezone, as it may create discrepancies due to timezone differences.
