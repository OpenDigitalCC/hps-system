Function signature: 55e8d084d35a9ef0acf688a6988fcc8e9d78706249d3d106334d8cebd1f456b1

### Function Overview

The Bash function `host_config()` manages host configurations based on a MAC address. The configuration includes getting, checking existence, adding, editing, or verifying configuration entries for a given MAC, while maintaining a record in a configuration file and avoiding cross-host reusability. 

### Technical Description

#### Name

`host_config`

#### Description

The `host_config()` function accepts four parameters: MAC address, a command (get, exists, equals or set), a key, and a value. It provides host configuration settings based on the MAC address. The function reads from a configuration file and maintains a map of configurations for a specific MAC address, avoiding cross-host reuse. While performing operations, the function also ensures that directories are correctly set up and displays error messages upon invalid input or failure of operations. 

#### Globals

- `VAR: HOST_CONFIG_FILE`: Default path of the configuration file.
- `VAR: HPS_HOST_CONFIG_DIR`: The directory where the configuration files are stored.

#### Arguments

- `$1: mac`: The MAC address of the host.
- `$2: cmd`: The command that needs to be executed (get, exists, equals, set).
- `$3: key`: The key of the configuration entry.
- `$4: value`: The value of the configuration entry if it is to be set.

#### Outputs

Data or configuration details on standard output depending on the command used.

#### Returns

Returns 0 if operation was successful, 1 if the configuration is absent, 2 for invalid key format or command, and 3 for failure in directory or file creation.

#### Example usage

```
host_config "00:00:00:00:00:00" "get" "key"
host_config "00:00:00:00:00:00" "set" "key" "value"
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Ensure that user-input data used in file-system operations are properly sanitized to prevent directory traversal attacks.
2. Include proper documentation to describe the possible return values and their meanings.
3. Consider adding validation checks for MAC addresses to avoid processing configurations for invalid MACs.
4. Include checksum validation for integrity of the configuration file, preventing data corruption and unauthorized changes.
5. Always use secure mechanisms and permissions for directory and file creation to avoid unauthorized access.
