### Function overview

The `ipxe_show_info` function is part of iPXE scripts within the Linux environment that serve to provide information about the host data, cluster configuration, host configuration, and HPS paths. The function uses here-documents and case statements in bash to format the output depending upon the category passed as an argument. It handles four category types: `show_ipxe`, `show_cluster`, `show_host`, and `show_paths`. For an unknown category, it chains a command to jump to the initial menu.

### Quality and security recommendations
1. *Input Validation*: The function could benefit from some form of input validation to ensure only the proper category labels are passed into the function.
2. *Documentation*: The use of more inline comments throughout the function would make it more understandable to others or even the same author in the future.
3. *Error Handling*: Implementing error handling strategies can improve the stability of the function. It seems there are already some checks for file existence, these could be expanded upon for more robust error handling.
4. *Permissions*: For security purposes, be mindful of providing only necessary permissions to files involved in this function. It’s important to only give the minimum permissions required to properly execute the function.
5. *Backup and Restore points*: Good to have backup and recovery mechanisms in place to avoid data loss during the runtime of scripts, particularly if they are writing, updating or deleting files.
