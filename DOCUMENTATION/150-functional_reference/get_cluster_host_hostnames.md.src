Contained in `lib/functions.d/cluster-functions.sh`

Function signature: 0a454d05c4d3133d2a88b66d07816dd02a6a5ae702c43b33ecd266836eee2f6a

### Function Overview

The `get_cluster_host_hostnames` function retrieves the hostnames of the hosts within a specified cluster in a network. The function can optionally filter hosts by the type of host. The function works by reading through each host's configuration file, applying the host type filter if specified, and then outputting the hostname if it exists.

### Technical Description

- **Name**: `get_cluster_host_hostnames`
- **Description**: This function gets the hostnames of hosts in a given cluster. It has an optional filter for the host type. The function reads through the configuration files of each host in the cluster, filters out hosts based on the host type filter if specified, and outputs the host's hostname.
- **Globals**: None
- **Arguments**: 
   - `$1`: The cluster name. If no value is provided, the function retrieves the active cluster.
   - `$2`: The host type filter. If set, the function only outputs hostnames of hosts that match this type. This input is optional.
- **Outputs**: The function outputs the hostnames of the hosts in the given cluster. It outputs each hostname on a separate line.
- **Returns**: The function returns 0 if it successfully retrieves the hostnames, and 1 if it fails to determine the host's directory.
- **Example Usage**:
    ```bash
    get_cluster_host_hostnames "my_cluster" "filter"
    ```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Implement better error handling. Right now, there's only a single check for if the `hosts_dir` cannot be determined. Additional error checks could be implemented for instance if `list_cluster_hosts "$cluster_name"` fails or returns an empty value.
2. The function reads from host configuration files without performing any validation. Before using the data retrieved from these files, validity checks should be implemented to ensure that the data format matches expectations.
3. The function may echo out an error message directly. It would be beneficial to redirect these error messages to a standard error stream and handle it properly to mimic how a normal UNIX command works.
4. The function uses the `grep -E` command to get certain properties from the host configuration files. While this does work, a more secure option would be to use a more precise tool or command designed for parsing configuration files, such as a standard Linux command or a parser library.
5. Included comments for each block of important code to enhance the readability and maintainability of the function.
