Function signature: 5e8124c7c913768226948ae7120083b2568d70860f21c6599d89e81df548ee7d

### Function Overview

The `get_active_cluster_hosts_dir` function in Bash is used to retrieve the hosts directory path for the current active cluster. By appending `/hosts` to the result of the `get_active_cluster_link_path` command, it creates a path to a 'hosts' directory that is expected to be a part of the active cluster's directory structure.

### Technical Description

**Name**: `get_active_cluster_hosts_dir`

**Description**: This function calls another function `get_active_cluster_link_path` to get the directory path of the active cluster and then appends `/hosts` at the end of the retrieved path. This will provide the 'hosts' directory inside the active cluster directory.

**Globals**: None

**Arguments**: No arguments are necessary for this function.

**Outputs**: The function will output the full path to the 'hosts' directory inside the current active cluster.

**Returns**: It returns the directory path as a string.

**Example Usage**: 
```bash
host_dir=$(get_active_cluster_hosts_dir)
echo $host_dir
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Logging: For enhanced debugging and error tracking, consider adding log statements in case of errors when retrieving the active cluster link path.
2. Input Validation: As this function relies on another function, you need to make sure that the `get_active_cluster_link_path` function has appropriate error checks and input validation.
3. Output Validation: It could be beneficial to verify if the returned directory exists and is accessible.
4. Error Handling: Implement error handling to ensure the function behaves predictably in exceptions, including when it cannot correctly fetch the active cluster link path.
5. Documentation: Include comments within the function to describe what the function does. This helps other developers understand the code.
6. Security: Check all file and directory permissions involved in the execution to ensure they're securely configured, as paths and directories often bear security implications in a system.
