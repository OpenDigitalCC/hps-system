Contained in `lib/functions.d/system-functions.sh`

Function signature: 34e636eb4b7c0c9bf98b49ce8416227a48485bd990954c5b7f74feba9f1c472a

### Function Overview

The `hps_origin_tag` function attempts to generate a unique tag based on the origin of a given process. The function considers several aspects such as an override option, user, host and process ID in the context of an interactive terminal, and also client IP/MAC in the context of a non-interactive terminal.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `hps_origin_tag`
- **Description:** This function generates a unique tag indicating the origin of a process. It first checks if an explicit override is provided. If the script is running from an interactive terminal, the function captures the user, host, and process ID. If the script is running from a non-tty environment (e.g., a web server), it attempts to use client IP/MAC information to generate the tag.
- **Globals:** `REMOTE_ADDR: Internet protocol address of remote computer`
- **Arguments:** `$1: Overrides the need for automatic origin determination`
- **Outputs:** Prints a string that stands as the unique origin tag. The format could be process ID, user-host data, IP or MAC address.
- **Returns:** `0` on successful execution
- **Example Usage:** `tag=$(hps_origin_tag)`

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Ensure proper validation and sanitation of command outputs like `id -un` and `hostname -s` to prevent any potential command injection attacks.
2. Use stringent error handling and check the return codes of executed commands as much as possible.
3. Avoid putting sensitive data like MAC addresses within origin tags as they can leak data by exposing it in logs or other output. If it is necessary, make sure logs/output storing these tags are adequately secured.
4. When printing out the tag, consider using an appropriate log level.
5. If the function fails to create a tag, it would be advisable to include fallback methods or return a standard error code.
