### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Error Handling: Currently, there is no error handling mechanism. Consider adding an error handling routine to catch and manage any potential errors from using the `date` command.
2. Return consistency: Currently, if the date command fails, it returns a different value. Ensuring the function always return a consistent output or an explicit error value can significantly improve usability.
3. Commenting: To improve maintainability, consider adding brief comments in the code describing what the function is doing.
