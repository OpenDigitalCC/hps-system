### Function overview

The function `ipxe_reboot` is designed to print a log message indicating a reboot request, followed by the actual reboot request. Initially, it defines a local variable `MSG` and assigns it the value of `$1`, the first argument passed to the function. If the `MSG` is not null, it is printed, and regardless, a standard rebooting message is printed. Finally, it waits for 5 seconds and then triggers the reboot.

### Technical description

- **Name:** `ipxe_reboot`
- **Description:** This function is used to log a reboot request and then reboot the system. This includes constructing a header using `ipxe_header`, printing a custom reboot message if provided, and echoing a standard "Rebooting..." message. It then instructs the system to sleep for 5 seconds before rebooting.
- **Globals:** No globals are used explicitly in this function.
- **Arguments:** 
   - `$1: MSG`: An optional message to be displayed during the reboot process.
- **Outputs:** 
  - If a message is provided as an argument (`MSG` is not null), it is printed.
  - A standard "Rebooting" message is always printed.
- **Returns:** The function doesn't return a value.
- **Example usage:** 

```bash
ipxe_reboot "Scheduled system reboot"
```

This will log a message "Reboot requested Scheduled system reboot", output the provided message, and then the system will reboot after a pause of 5 seconds.

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Buffer Overflow Protection: To avoid any risk of buffer overflow, the function should previously validate the length of the `$1` input argument before assigning it to the `MSG` variable. 

2. Error Handling: If the reboot command fails to execute, this function doesn't handle it. This can be improved by adding error handling routines or exit codes checking for each command in the function. 

3. Secure Logging: The function simply logs the message, "Reboot requested $MSG". To ensure secure logging, it should also log the identity of the user or process that initiated the reboot, and timestamp each log entry.

4. Documentation: Each step and the overall purpose of the function should be properly documented in the code.
