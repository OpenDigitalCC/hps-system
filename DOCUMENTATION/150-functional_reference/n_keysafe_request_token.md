Function signature: 43c0b2dc4a1a9560d4393853037cc9eaf34c1e671a67475620b7086e407cea75

### Function overview

The `n_keysafe_request_token` function is designed to request a token from the IPS via the `n_ips_command` wrapper, given a specific purpose. This function first validates the provided purpose argument and if valid, the token request is initiated. The function also handles failures in communication with the IPS and checks the response for any errors. If no errors are found, the function filters out warning messages and extra output, to finally return the token.

### Technical description

- Name: `n_keysafe_request_token`
- Description: This function is responsible for requesting a token from IPS. It validates the provided purpose, ensures communication with IPS, and checks IPS's response for errors. Upon successful request, it cleans up the response by filtering out any warnings or extra output and returns the token.
- Globals: None
- Arguments: 
  - `$1: purpose` - description of the purpose for which the token is requested
- Outputs: 
  - On success, returns the token requested from IPS.
  - On failure, outputs error messages indicating the lack of required purpose, failure in communication with IPS, or an error contained in the response.
- Returns:
  - `0` if the token is successfully requested and returned
  - `1` if the communication with IPS failed
  - `2` if the required argument purpose is not provided
  - `3` if the response from IPS contains an error
- Example usage:
  - ```
    n_keysafe_request_token "password_reset"
    ```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Implement stricter input validation. The current version accepts any non-empty string as a valid purpose.
2. Replace the `echo` command with `printf` to avoid potential issues with input that could be treated as options or flags.
3. Consider encrypting the token when sending and decrypting once received to ensure its security while in transit.
4. Keep track of the number of token requests and limit them to prevent potential abuse of the function.
5. Include more granular error checking, such as checking for specific types of errors returned in the response.
6. Include thorough logging for any errors or exceptions for monitoring and debugging. Ensure sensitive information isn't logged in such process.
