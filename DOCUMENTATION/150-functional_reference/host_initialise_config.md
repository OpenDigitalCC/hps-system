### Function overview

The `host_initialise_config` function in Bash is designed to initialise the host configuration for the provided MAC address. It validates if the MAC address is provided and determines the hosts directory for the active cluster. If the hosts directory does not exist, it creates one. And then it sets an initial state using `host_config`. It will fail to set up the initial state it will log an error message and terminate the function returning 1. If all operations succeed, it logs an information message with the config file path and returns 0.

### Technical description

- name: `host_initialise_config`
- description: Initialises a host configuration based on a given MAC address. Creates the corresponding directories if they are non-existant, and sets the initial state.
- globals: None
- arguments: 
  - `$1`: MAC address that needs the initialisation of a host configuration.
- outputs: Logs various states of configuration initialisation, including errors and informational messages about successfully created directory and initialised host config.
- returns: `0` if the host configuration was successfully initialised and `1` if the MAC address was not provided or any issues occurred during the config initialisation process.
- example usage: `host_initialise_config 00:0a:95:9d:68:16`

### Quality and security recommendations

1. The function could include more detailed logging of errors, including the specific error messages that resulted from the function calls. This would allow for faster and more accurate troubleshooting of any issues encountered during runtime.
2. The function could include functionality to validate the format of the provided MAC address before proceeding with the rest of the function. This would prevent potential errors or unexpected behavior if an invalid MAC address is provided.
3. To improve security, consider adjusting the permissions on the created folders and files to limit access to those who need it. Providing unrestricted access might lead to potential security vulnerabilities. Make sure that any information related to errors (such as directory locations) is not displayed to regular users, to prevent potential information leaks.
4. To ensure the function behaves as expected, implement unit testing and include edge cases such as an empty string, a non-existent directory, or a MAC address that already has a corresponding configuration.
