Contained in `lib/functions.d/cluster-functions.sh`

Function signature: fc7feb39024383e4cb59d1bec6341e1f7248d7dd978aa33bac047e372cc4613e

### Function overview

The `get_cluster_conf_file` function takes a cluster name as an argument and returns the path to its configuration file. If no cluster name is provided, it prints out an error message and exits the function.

### Technical description

**Name:**  
`get_cluster_conf_file`

**Description:**  
This Bash function takes a cluster name as an argument and returns the path of the configuration file for that cluster. It first checks if a cluster name has been provided, if not an error message is printed and the function exits. It then gets the path to the cluster using the `get_cluster_dir` function. 

**Globals:**  
No global variables are used in this function.

**Arguments:**  
- `$1`: The name of the cluster

**Outputs:**  
- If no cluster name is provided, an error message is printed to stderr:
`[ERROR] Usage: get_cluster_conf_file <cluster-name>`

- If successful, it prints the path to the cluster's configuration file

**Returns:**  
- `1` if no cluster name is provided or if `get_cluster_dir` function fails
- `0` if the function executes successfully

**Example usage:**  
`get_cluster_conf_file my-cluster`

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Consider using more descriptive error messages. Instead of `[ERROR] Usage: get_cluster_conf_file <cluster-name>`, something like `[ERROR] Missing required argument: cluster_name` might be more helpful to users.
2. This function trusts that the `get_cluster_dir` function is well-implemented and doesn't validate the return value other than checking for errors. If `get_cluster_dir` could potentially return a harmful or malicious path, then this function will pass it along to the caller.
3. This function assumes that there is always a `cluster.conf` file inside the directory returned by `get_cluster_dir`. Ensure proper error handling if the file does not exist.
4. Avoiding using hardcoded strings (e.g. "/cluster.conf") which could potentially cause problems in the future if there is a change in the configuration filenames or directory structure. Consider using a configuration or properties file to manage these.
