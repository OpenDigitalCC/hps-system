Contained in `lib/functions.d/cluster-functions.sh`

Function signature: d5981ec28473618b5cd51e9c3ade1ff3471cc55b1c1da368f886f31feec27ee4

### Function Overview

The `initialise_cluster` function is a Bash function designed to setup and initialize a new cluster. The function checks if the user has provided a cluster name and if the cluster directory already exists. If the cluster name is not provided or if the cluster directory already exists, it produces an error log and terminates. If the checks are successful, it will create a new directory structure for the new cluster along with a cluster configuration file. Finally, it will set the cluster's name in the configuration and call the function `export_dynamic_paths`. If this function call fails, it will log an error and terminate.

### Technical Description

- **Name**: `initialise_cluster`
- **Description**: Initialises a new cluster by creating the necessary directory structure and cluster configuration file. Sets the cluster's name in the configuration. Calls `export_dynamic_paths` and exits if this function call fails.
- **Globals**: [ `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR`: The base directory where cluster directories are located. ]
- **Arguments**: [ `$1` (cluster_name): User provided name for the new cluster]
- **Outputs**: Logs and errors to stdout
- **Returns**: 
  - 0 if the function completes successfully
  - 1 if no cluster name is provided
  - 2 if the cluster directory already exists
  - 3 if the call to `export_dynamic_paths` fails
- **Example Usage**: Initialise a new cluster named "my_cluster" with `initialise_cluster "my_cluster"`

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Make sure the variable `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR` is defined in a secure location that the current user has read, write, and execute permissions on.
2. Add input validation for the cluster name to prevent any possible command injection vulnerabilities.
3. User should have appropriate permissions to execute this function and handle the involved directory and files.
4. Function should handle exceptions and edge cases more efficiently.
5. Logging mechanism should be more specific about the types of errors and conditions occurring during the function execution.
