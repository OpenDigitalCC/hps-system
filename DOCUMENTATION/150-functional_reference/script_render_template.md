### Function Overview

The `script_render_template()` function is designed to remap all variable placeholders (`@...@`) with their corresponding values (`${...}`). The function cycles through all the variables using `compgen -v`, assigns the value of the variable to a local variable, and then adds it to an array of values for `awk`. The `awk` utility then processes the array of values, replacing each placeholder in the original string with the corresponding variable value.

### Technical Description

- **Name**: `script_render_template`
- **Description**: This function is used to remap variable placeholders with their actual value. It does this using the `awk` utility and a for loop iterating over all variables in the scope.
- **Globals**: None
- **Arguments**: The function does not require any arguments. It acts on all variables in its scope.
- **Outputs**: The function outputs a string with all `@var@` placeholders replaced with their corresponding `${...}` values.
- **Returns**: The function does not have a return value.
- **Example Usage**:
  Assume that the following variables are already defined in the context:
  ```bash
  script_name='MyScript'
  script_version='1.0'
  ```
  If we call `script_render_template` in a context where a template string like `'This is @script_name@ version @script_version@'` is present, the function will output the string `'This is MyScript version 1.0'`.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Always make sure the substitution values (`${...}`) are securely obtained and sanitized to prevent command injection attacks.
2. Consider validating the variable names that `compgen -v` produces to ensure they adhere to expected patterns and rules.
3. Beware of potential performance issues if the function is used in a context with a large number of variables.
4. Handle errors and exceptions gracefully. For instance, what should happen if a placeholder variable does not exist?
5. Ensure that the function fits well within your specific use case, as its current implementation is very general and may not be suitable for more specific tasks.
