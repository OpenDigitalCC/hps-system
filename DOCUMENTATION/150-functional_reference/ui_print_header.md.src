### Function Overview

The `ui_print_header()` function in Bash is a utility function built for printing headers in terminal-based user interfaces. The function itself is quite straightforward - it accepts a string as an argument which is then displayed as a title within a border of equals signs (`=`) before and after the title.

### Technical Description

**Name:** `ui_print_header()`  
**Description:** This function prints a passed title surrounded by a set of equals signs (`=`) on the lines before and after the title. This creates a clear and visually distinct header within a terminal or console.  
**Globals:** None  
**Arguments:**  
- `$1: title` - This is a string placeholder that the function expects. This value is what the function will print out as the header text.  
**Outputs:** This function prints to stdout. The printout consists of an empty line, then a line of equals signs, followed by the title, another line of equals signs, and finally, another empty line.  
**Returns:** Returns nothing.  
**Example Usage:** `ui_print_header "Welcome to My Program"` - Will print:

```
===================================
   Welcome to My Program
===================================
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Be aware that there are no sanity checks on the supplied argument. The function will print whatever is supplied as an argument, making it susceptible to potentially handling unexpected or rogue inputs. Therefore, consider validating or sanitizing the input on a higher level of function call.
2. This function does not check the length of input strings. If an excessively long string is supplied as an argument it can lead to inconsistent formatting and potentially unreadable headers.
3. The function doesn't use the locale settings to determine the orientation of the symbols. This may cause issues when it is used in locales that use right-to-left writing systems.
4. As the function doesn't return anything it would not be suitable for scenarios where error handling or feedback would be required based on the output of the function.
