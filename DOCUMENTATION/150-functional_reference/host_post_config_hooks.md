### Function Overview

The function `host_post_config_hooks()` takes as arguments a key and a value, and performs actions based on the key provided. Within the function, a hook mapping is defined, associating specific keys with specific functions to be performed. If the key provided as an argument is found in the hook mappings, the associated function is executed; the execution is logged and any output is suppressed. If the function fails, a warning message is logged. Regardless of the execution outcome, the function always returns a success status.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Ensure error handling is robust: Currently the function handles hook function failures. This could, however, be made more robust by handling more exceptions and adding more informative logs.
2. Consider limiting the keys and values that can be added: To prevent misuse of the function, consider enforcing restrictions or validity checks on the key-value pairs passed.
3. Encrypt sensitive data: If the key-value pairs contain sensitive data, consider encrypting them to enhance security.
4. Always sanitize input: As a general security concept, any inputs passed into functions should be sanitized properly. A check should be added to handle malicious or unintended key-value inputs.
5. Follow the least privilege principle: Make sure that your script is running with the lowest permissions possible. This reduces the chance of the script making unwanted or harmful changes.
