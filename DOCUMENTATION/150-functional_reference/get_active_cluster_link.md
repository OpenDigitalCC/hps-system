### Function overview

The `get_active_cluster_link` function is a Bash function used to get the active cluster link in a system. It first assigns the output of `get_active_cluster_link_path` function to the `link` variable and then checks if this link is a symbolic link. If not, it prints an error message and returns `1`. If the link is a symbolic link, it simply echoes the `link` - printing the link.


### Technical description
* **Name:** get_active_cluster_link
* **Description:** This function is used to retrieve the link to the active cluster in a system. It returns an error if the link does not exist or isn't a symbolic link.
* **Globals:** None
* **Arguments:** None
* **Outputs:** If successful, prints the active cluster link to stdout. If not, an error message is printed to stderr.
* **Returns:** The function returns `0` if the active cluster link is retrieved successfully, and `1` if either no link exists or the link isn't a symbolic link.
* **Example usage:** 
  ```
  get_active_cluster_link

### Quality and security recommendations

1. The function does not have any arguments. As such, it would run with any number of arguments provided. To improve quality, error checking can be added to enforce that no arguments are expected.
2. It assumes that `get_active_cluster_link_path` function has already been defined and works correctly. To improve maintainability, there should always be a check if a function exists before it's called.
3. Logging level of error could be standardized. Instead of directly printing to stderr, a logging function can be used to control the logging levels.
4. Error messages printed are currently hardcoded strings. To increase maintainability and readability, these error messages can be converted to constants at the top of the script or inside a configuration file.
5. For security improvements, input validation is a must. For this specific function, checking that the path points to an expected location can prevent symbolic link attacks. For instance, the bash function "realpath" could be used.
6. Lastly, the function needs to handle permissions errors gracefully. It can use defensive programming practices to ensure that the user running the script has the authority to access the link.
