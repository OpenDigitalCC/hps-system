### Function overview

The `n_remote_log` function is a bash function implemented to log the events or activities that occur during a build process within the OSVC structure. The function accomplishes this by sending log messages to the system's logger with an attribute identifying it as an osvc-build. Additionally, it echoes a similar message to the standard output for immediate user feedback.

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Validation of Input: It would be prudent to validate the `$1` input to confirm that it is a string and is not injecting any harmful content. 
2. Error Handling: The function should implement proper error handling to ensure a graceful failure if the logger operation fails.
3. Documentation: Each argument and the functionality of the function should be properly documented for maintainability and the benefit of other developers.
4. Permission Check: Ensure that the logger function is not called with higher privileges to avoid security risks.
5. Independent Testing: Consider carrying out independent unit and integration tests to assess the function's behavior under various conditions.
6. Logging Levels: Consider implementing logging levels (e.g., Info, Warning, Error) to help distinguish the importance of log entries.
