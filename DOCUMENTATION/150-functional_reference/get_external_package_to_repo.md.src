### Quality and security recommendations

1. Use absolute paths for the repository path to avoid potential confusions or errors with relative paths.
2. Validate the URL more thoroughly. Currently, it only checks if the URL ends with `.rpm`. More comprehensive validation would be beneficial.
3. Use the `-s` (silent) option with `curl` to suppress unnecessary output and only display important information.
4. Consider using a more secure protocol, such as HTTPS, for downloading the package to ensure the integrity and security of the download. 
5. Add more detailed logging, including timestamps and the full file path of the downloaded files, to allow easier troubleshooting.
6. Rather than relying on return codes, consider propagating more detailed error information to give invokers more context of failures.
