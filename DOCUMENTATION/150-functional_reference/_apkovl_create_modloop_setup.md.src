### Function Overview

The function `_apkovl_create_modloop_setup()` sets up a modloop for Alpine Linux. Its main tasks are constructing a local directory, defining the modules to load, creating a modloop setup script that downloads, mounts, and loads kernel modules, and finally confirming that the setup script is executable. It accepts three arguments representing the base directory, the gateway IP, and the Alpine version.

### Technical Description

- **Name**: `_apkovl_create_modloop_setup`
- **Description**: This function sets up a modloop by creating a local directory, defining the modules to load, creating a setup script that downloads the kernel modules, mounts them, and loads them.
- **Globals**: No global variables are used directly, but function calls to `hps_log` may use predefined globals within that function.
- **Arguments**: 
  - `$1` (base_dir): Base directory where the local.d directory will be created
  - `$2` (gateway_ip): Gateway IP address used in MODLOOP_URL
  - `$3` (alpine_version): Version of Alpine Linux used in MODLOOP_URL
- **Outputs**: Logs (debug and error level) generated by `hps_log`, and a modloop setup script placed in the local.d directory.
- **Returns**: Returns 1 if the local.d directory or the setup script couldn't be created, otherwise returns 0.
- **Example usage**:
  ```bash
  _apkovl_create_modloop_setup "/home/user/directory" "192.168.0.1" "3.11"
  ```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Make sure argument validation is in place. This function already uses bash's null variable `-?` option to ensure the required arguments are provided.
2. Add more descriptive error messages in `hps_log` calls for better troubleshooting.
3. Make sure permissions for newly created directory and setup script are properly set to ensure security.
4. Use HTTPS instead of HTTP in URL for modloop download to add an extra layer of security.
5. Integrate logging into a central solution to identify potential security threats or malpractices.
6. Check the existence of directories and files before trying to create or modify them.
7. Before downloading the modloop, consider adding a checksum validation to confirm file integrity.
