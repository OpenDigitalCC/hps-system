### Function overview

`n_install_base_services` is a Bash function designed to install and start base services on a system using the apk package manager. This function starts by defining two local variables (PACKAGES and SERVICES) which hold the names of the packages and services, respectively. The function creates logs of its operations using the `n_remote_log` function. It updates the apk index, installs the specified packages, and proceeds to enable and start the services one by one. If any of these processes fails, an error log is generated and the function returns 1. If all the steps are successfully executed, a success log is created and the function returns 0.

### Quality and security recommendations

1. To improve the flexibility of the function, arguments could be added to allow the user to define specific packages and services rather than working off a predefined list.
2. Robust error handling is already implemented, but detailed error messages that can guide troubleshooting would be beneficial.
3. Incorporate a mechanism to check if the service/package already exists on the system. Thereby, avoiding unnecessary installations or errors.
4. Thoroughly document the function, especially when making changes or updates, to ensure that it remains user-friendly and accessible to other programmers.
5. Always check the validity of packages to be installed to prevent potential security breaches.
6. Be wary of potential injection attacks by sanitizing any user-provided input.
