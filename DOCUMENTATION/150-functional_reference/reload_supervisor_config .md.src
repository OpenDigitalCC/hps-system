Function signature: 801a3a3ce92c702dec9ce6d4e3f934d7c00912f618d4ee77b376437d911ce3c6

### Function overview

The `reload_supervisor_config` function helps in updating the existing supervisor's configuration. It uses the `get_path_supervisord_conf` function to get the supervisor's configuration file path. It then logs information about the steps taken to read the configuration file again and update its contents using `supervisorctl -c` command.

### Technical description

```bash
function reload_supervisor_config {
    local SUPERVISORD_CONF="$(get_path_supervisord_conf)"
    hps_log info "Reread: $(supervisorctl -c "$SUPERVISORD_CONF" reread) $?"
    hps_log info "Update: $(supervisorctl -c "$SUPERVISORD_CONF" update) $?"
}
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Implement parent-child process tracking system that could kill or suspend a set of processes if necessary, for achieving higher levels of control over processes that provides increased security.
2. Add exception handling mechanism to the `reload_supervisor_config` function to handle any errors during the re-reading or updating of the supervisor's configuration file. This will prevent failure of the entire script due to an error in the supervisor's configuration file.
3. Use absolute path for invoking `supervisorctl` to ensure that the correct and intended binary is invoked as per the system's `$PATH` settings.
4. Validate the output of the `get_path_supervisord_conf` function before using it to ensure it correctly points at a supervisor's configuration file. This can prevent exposure of potential security risk, such as filesystem traversal and denial of service (DoS) vulnerabilities.
5. Log all errors encountered during the execution of the `reload_supervisor_config` function to an error log file. This would aid in debugging and probing security-related issues.
