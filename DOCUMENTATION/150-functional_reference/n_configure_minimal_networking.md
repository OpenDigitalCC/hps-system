### Function Overview
The function `n_configure_minimal_networking` configures minimal networking for a Linux machine. It is particularly aimed at enabling the service dependencies to initialize and operate properly.

The function first collects networking details such as the principal interface, IP address, netmask, and gateway for the Linux machine. A loopback interface is then brought up if not yet up since it is critical for many services. It then ensures that networking is included in the system boot runlevel to support future machine restarts. Finally, if the networking service is not running already, an attempt is made to start it.

### Technical Description
- **name:** n_configure_minimal_networking
- **description:** Configures minimal networking for a machine ensuring service dependencies are met. It sets up the primary network interface, gateway, and adds networking to boot runlevel. If networking service is not running, it is started.
- **globals:** None.
- **arguments:** None.
- **outputs:** Creates a '/etc/network/interfaces' file with the appropriate network configuration, and commands to start networking service in the console.
- **returns:** If successful, exits with a 0 status code. If the networking service can't be started, it exits with a status code of 1.
- **example usage:**
    ```bash
    n_configure_minimal_networking
    ```

### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. Secure the route information - The function currently extracts the gateway directly from the routing table. An attacker might manipulate this information leading to a potential security issue. Validate and sanitize the input consumed from the routing table to guard against injection attacks.
2. Enhance error handling - Right now, if thereâ€™s any failure, error handling is quite generic. Specific and clear error messages should be returned for each failure scenario to aid in troubleshooting.
3. Secure temp file - The function writes network configuration to '/etc/network/interfaces'. Any potential security issues associated with file permissions, access rights, and data within the file should be well handled.
4. Consider using more secure coding practices like hardcoded values (for netmask, for example) can be replaced with queries to relevant resources.
5. Include logging functionality - To ensure traceability and easier debugging, consider including logging functionality that provides an audit trail of actions performed by this function.
6. Validate network state before configuration - To avoid unnecessary cycles and operations, check the network state before proceeding with the configuration. This will also avoid overlapping configurations which may lead to errors or unpredicted behaviors.
