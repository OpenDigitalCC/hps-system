Function signature: d87371da5d1ef4cf5f7025f69387b9e18a089f696a2ece496bc5166f820d9398

### Function Overview

The function `n_configure_motd()` is used to configure the Message Of The Day (MOTD) with information about the node on a Unix/Linux system. The MOTD is a brief message that users see when they log into a system. This function generates a dynamic MOTD that displays node information on user login. It also creates a static MOTD where node information is stored.

### Technical Description

- Name: `n_configure_motd`
- Description: This function configures the MOTD with node information. It first creates a script with the name `hps-motd.sh` in the directory `/etc/profile.d/` that generates a dynamic MOTD. The dynamic MOTD shows node information on a user login. The function further creates a static MOTD where it stores the node information. Finally, the function logs that the MOTD has been configured.
- Globals: None
- Arguments: No arguments are passed to this function.
- Outputs: This function does not explicitly output any value to the stdout, it updates and creates system files `/etc/profile.d/hps-motd.sh` and `/etc/motd`, and logs messages using `n_remote_log` function.
- Returns: Always returns 0 indicating successful execution.
- Example usage: To configure the MOTD with node information, you can call the function as follows `n_configure_motd`

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. All global variables and constants should be defined at the beginning of the script to improve readability and ease of maintenance.
2. Always define the directory paths and filenames as variables at the beginning of the script. It's especially useful when several functions are part of the same script or if you expect to reuse the function in different contexts.
3. Use the bash `set -e` option at the beginning of your script to make sure the script exits whenever any command it runs exits with a non-zero status.
4. Make sure that permissions of MOTD scripts and static files are appropriate and do not allow unauthorized access. The default permissions set by `chmod +x` might not always be the best choice.
5. Always log successes and errors in your function to a log file. Using `n_remote_log` function seems to be a good choice.
6. In most Linux distributions, you may need root/sudo privileges to make changes in `/etc/motd` or `/etc/profile.d/`. Always use caution to avoid overwriting crucial system files.
7. Make sure that scripts and commands are shielded against injection and other types of attacks.
