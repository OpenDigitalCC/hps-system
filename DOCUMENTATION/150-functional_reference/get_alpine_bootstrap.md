Function signature: 6d5c7768966553e101da81968a5d1d06f7a887f781e76db0807a69dcaef396ac

### Function overview

The `get_alpine_bootstrap` function provides a mechanism for generating a bootstrap script for a given stage within an Alpine Linux environment. The function does this by retrieving the gateway IP from the cluster configuration and using it as part of creating either an `initramfs` or `rc` bootstrap script, depending on the stage specified.

### Technical description

* **name**: `get_alpine_bootstrap`
* **description**: This function is intended to generate a bootstrap script for a specified stage within an Alpine Linux environment. The specific stage (either 'initramfs' or 'rc') is indicated by the passed argument. If no stage is passed, the default is 'initramfs'. The gateway IP gathered from the cluster configuration is utilized in generating the appropriate bootstrap script.
* **globals**: [ `gateway_ip`: This variable holds the gateway IP retrieved from the cluster configuration. ]
* **arguments**: [ `$1`: Stage indicator, it determines if an 'initramfs' or 'rc' bootstrap script is to be generated. The default is 'initramfs' if no argument is passed. ]
* **outputs**: It outputs an error message with `hps_log` function in case of failure in getting the gateway IP from cluster configuration or if an invalid stage parameter is passed.
* **returns**: If an invalid stage parameter is passed, it returns with an exit code of 1.
* **example usage**: 

```bash
get_alpine_bootstrap initramfs
```
  
### Quality and security recommendations

1. Secure the IP retrieval by validating the response from the `cluster_config get DHCP_IP` command. For instance, check if the returned IP is valid to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
2. Incorporate more error checks to ensure the reliability of the script. For instance, check if the `generate_initramfs_script` and `generate_rc_script` functions get executed successfully.
3. Validate the `stage` argument before using it to ensure it is properly formatted and as expected, rather than after. This helps prevent potential security risks from improperly formatted or unexpected arguments.
4. Implement logging for audit and troubleshooting purposes. Logs can facilitate problem identification and can be valuable when troubleshooting an issue.
5. Avoid using globals where possible, by passing variables as arguments to functions, as globals may lead to name clashes and hard to debug issues.
