Contained in `lib/functions.d/supervisor-functions.sh`

Function signature: 0345bed3892a583ce9b3784d2a299e461cb5222d290ab544e398bb4aa3d81533

### Function Overview

This function, `create_supervisor_services_config`, is designed to create service configuration files for a system supervisor. This is achieved through calling a sequence of other functions `create_config_nginx`, `create_config_dnsmasq`, and `create_config_opensvc`. The latter one is specified as an IPS node.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** create_supervisor_services_config
- **Description:** This function generates service configuration files for a supervisor. It sequentially calls three functions: `create_config_nginx`, `create_config_dnsmasq`, and `create_config_opensvc`.
- **Globals:** None
- **Arguments:** This function does not take any arguments.
- **Outputs:** Configuration files for `nginx`, `dnsmasq`, and `opensvc` as an IPS node. Exact locations and formats will depend on the implemented details in the subordinate functions (`create_config_nginx`, `create_config_dnsmasq`,`create_config_opensvc`).
- **Returns:** This function does not explicitly return any value.
- **Example usage:** 

    Here's an example of how you might call this function in your code:

    ```bash
    create_supervisor_services_config
    ```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Consider adding error checking to ensure that each configuration file was successfully created. You could modify the subordinate functions to return a status code, and then check that code after each function call in `create_supervisor_services_config`.

2. If the configuration files contain sensitive information, ensure that they are created with restrictive permissions to prevent unauthorized access.

3. Document the expected behavior and potential side effects of the subordinate functions (`create_config_nginx`, `create_config_dnsmasq`,`create_config_opensvc`). This will help users of `create_supervisor_services_config` understand its behavior and requirements.

4. To improve code reusability and readability, you might consider passing the type of node ('IPS' in this case) as an argument to the function instead of hard-coding it in the function call. 

5. Always keep your system updated and patched. This can help to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities related to the services being configured.
