### 1. Function Overview

The `remote_function_lib` function in Bash is a method to output a collection of functions that are supposed to be introduced into the pre and post sections of a script or command sequence. This function can be extremely useful in scenarios where repeated sections of code are needed across various parts of a script, allowing the user to maintain the DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself) principle. While the function currently outputs a predefined set of functions directly into the pre and post sections, future enhancements might permit the functions to be defined within an independent file and imported when needed.

### 2. Technical Description

- **Name**: `remote_function_lib`
- **Description**: A Bash function that outputs multiple functions to be used in pre and post script/command sequences.
- **Globals**: None.
- **Arguments**: No explicit arguments.
- **Outputs**: A collection of functions that can be injected into the pre and post sections of a script or command sequence.
- **Returns**: The function does not explicitly return any value; it instead outputs multiple functions to be used elsewhere.
- **Example Usage**:
```bash
remote_function_lib
```

### 3. Quality and Security Recommendations

1. To enhance code readability, consider moving the return functions into an independent file. This independent file can then be called within this function.
2. It would be better to include proper namings of the functions as comments to enhance readability.
3. For security purposes, consider adding input validations when the function starts handling command-line arguments.
4. Avoid exporting unnecessary global variables. They can conflict with variables from other parts of the scripts or be manipulated by unauthorized users.
5. Always use the latest version of Bash to get higher security and better new features from the latest updates.
6. Regularly run your code through static code analyzers (like ShellCheck) to catch potential bugs and security issues.
