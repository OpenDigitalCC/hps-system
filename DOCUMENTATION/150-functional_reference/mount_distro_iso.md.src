### Function Overview

The `mount_distro_iso` function is used to mount an ISO file of a Linux distribution. The function takes a string as an argument that represents the name of the Linux distribution. It checks for the presence of the ISO file in a predefined directory. If the ISO file exists, the function then proceeds to check if the ISO file is already mounted. If not, the function creates a mount point directory and mounts the ISO file to it.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Incorporate comprehensive error handling and validation checks. This will help in ensuring that the mounted ISO file is legitimate and not corrupted.
2. Make sure to properly sanitize the `DISTRO_STRING` input. This will protect against potential code injection risks.
3. Document the expected values for each input variable. This would help prevent errors when the function is used by other team members.
4. Use a more descriptive name for the `hps_log` function. This would make the function more understandable to other developers who might read the code.
5. Write unit tests for this function to ensure it behaves as expected under different scenarios.
