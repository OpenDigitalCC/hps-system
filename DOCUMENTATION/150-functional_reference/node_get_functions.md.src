Function signature: b2883b20d00bf1410826493a19e1813813646b745f60e6597368a6746cba3d92

### Function Overview

The `node_get_functions` is a bash function that is used to fetch function scripts according to the given distro and function directory, or optionally, `LIB_DIR` environment variables. The function constructs a function bundle, which includes pre-defined function scripts like preload.sh and postload.sh, alongside other function scripts corresponding to the components of the provided distro and an optional set profile. The function has an inbuilt logging mechanism that logs info, error or debug messages based on the operations performed.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** node_get_functions
- **Description:** This function is used to fetch function scripts based on distro and function directory, or `LIB_DIR` environment variables and optionally a provided profile. It builds a function bundle comprising of pre-load and post-load scripts alongside other specific patterns.
- **Globals:** [ LIB_DIR: User-defined host-scripts directory path ]
- **Arguments:** [ $1: distro, $2: base directory path ]
- **Outputs:** Logs with information, error, or debug messages about operations performed, function bundle headers and the content of function script files found matching the patterns.
- **Returns:** Returns error code 2 if the host configuration for HOST_PROFILE fails to fetch.
- **Example usage:**
  - `node_get_functions ubuntu16 /path/to/host-scripts.d`
  
### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Ensure that variables are always scoped correctly. For instance, the function uses local variables, reducing the risk of variable overwriting and clashing.
2. Remember that error outputs are redirected to `/dev/null`, while necessary errors and info are logged using the `hps_log` function. This prevents cluttering of the surface-level output while preserving necessary auxiliary and debugging information.
3. Always check the validity of the script files before attempting to include them. This function does so by using the `-f` flag in conditions.
4. Monitor the length and complexity of your function. Break down your function into smaller, more manageable functions if possible.
5. Add comments throughout your code to make it more readable and comprehensible. This function already has ample commenting, making it easy to follow the logic.
6. Variables that are used as flags, such as `had_nullglob`, should be clearly defined and commented to explain their purpose.
7. The script should handle errors gracefully. For instance, this script logs an error and returns an error code when it fails to get the HOST_PROFILE from host-config.
8. Remember to reset the environment effects the function induces, such as turning off the nullglob when it's done.
