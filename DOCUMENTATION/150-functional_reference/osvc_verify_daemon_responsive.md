### Function Overview

The function `osvc_verify_daemon_responsive()` is used to check the responsiveness of the OpenSVC daemon. It attempts to get the status of the OpenSVC cluster and based on the result it returns either a success or a failure message. It logs the process and the status of the responsiveness of the daemon.

### Technical Description

- **Name**: `osvc_verify_daemon_responsive`
- **Description**: This function verifies if the OpenSVC daemon is responsive. It tries to get the status of the OpenSVC cluster and logs the process. It returns 0 if the daemon is responsive and exits with a status of 1 if it isn't.
- **Globals**: None
- **Arguments**: None
- **Outputs**: This function logs the process and the result of the verification of the OpenSVC daemon's responsiveness.
- **Returns**: 
    - 0 if the OpenSVC daemon is responsive
    - Exits the program with a status of 1 if the daemon isn't responsive
- **Example usage**: 
```bash

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Adding error handling mechanisms to manage unexpected errors that might occur while getting the OpenSVC cluster status.
2. It might be useful to customise the exit status codes to indicate different types of errors, instead of using only 1 for any error.
3. This function depends on the `om` and `hps_log` commands. Ensure that these commands are secure and permissions are correctly set.
4. It would be beneficial to implement a log rotation system for the log files to avoid them becoming too large and to maintain the logging system's efficiency.
5. Avoid using global variables as much as possible to enhance security and prevent unintended side-effects.
6. Regularly update and audit the dependencies (`om` and `hps_log` commands) utilised in this function for any known vulnerabilities.
