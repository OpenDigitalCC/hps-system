### Function Overview

The `generate_rc_script()` function is used in bash shell scripting to generate an initialization script with pre-defined actions and configurations. The function writes a shell script that first prints a bootstrap starting message. Then, updates a package repository configuration file under `/etc/apk/repositories` by overwriting it with a specified download link for the Alpine Linux distribution. Afterward, it updates the system's packages database and installs the latest versions of 'bash' and 'curl'. Finally, the function executes a `boot_manager.sh` script located at a specified gateway IP address. All the mentioned processes ensure an effective and controlled system bootstrap setup.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `generate_rc_script()`

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Always validate the gateway IP argument to ensure it is correctly formatted and it's a reachable network destination, to prevent errors and possible command injection.
2. Consider making the repository path and the boot manager script URL configurable rather than hard-coded, this will make the function more versatile for different scenarios.
3. Always ensure that the bash and curl installed via apk are verified and from a trusted source to avoid installing malicious versions.
4. Consider checking the status of the curl request to the boot manager script to ensure the request is successful.
5. Use secure and encrypted connections ('https' instead of 'http') for curl requests to add a layer of security and authenticity.
6. You might also want to employ error handling with each system command to ensure smooth script execution.
