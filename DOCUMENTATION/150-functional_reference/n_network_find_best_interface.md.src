### `n_network_find_best_interface`

Contained in `lib/node-functions.d/common.d/n_network-functions.sh`

Function signature: 6460d83e233fbb1d6aee3d49a4c4ee8e3c1c2b0a9e11a765b0eaf94aaad8b4a9

### Function Overview

The function `n_network_find_best_interface` performs a useful task of finding the best network interface based on the speed and state from a list of network interfaces. This function takes an input of minimum speed and the required state with default parameters of 0 and "up" respectively. The function reads through the list of interfaces, compares their speeds with the minimum speed input and tracks down the one with the highest speed. The function then echoes the interface with the highest speed that matched the state requirement.

### Technical Description
```markdown
- name: n_network_find_best_interface
- description: This function is used to find the best network interface based on the speed and state. It compares different interfaces' speeds with a provided minimum speed and tracks the fastest one. If the speed is equal it chooses the one that wasn't chosen before.
- globals: None.
- arguments: [ $1: minimum speed (optional) with 0 as default, $2: required state (optional) with 'up' as default ]
- outputs: The function returns the fastest interface's name in standard output.
- returns: 0 if any interface with the required speed and state was found, 1 otherwise.
- example usage: 

   n_network_find_best_interface 50 up
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. Perform validation on input parameters to ensure that speed is a number and state is a valid network state.
2. Add error handling or exceptions to check if `n_network_get_interfaces` fails or provides incorrect data.
3. Ensure that all variables are initialized and declared properly to prevent unexpected behavior.
4. Add comments and explanations within the body of the function to provide clarity on what complex parts do.
5. For enhanced security, consider running the script with the least privileged user. Use the principle of least privilege to help prevent data breaches and other malicious events.
6. Avoid revealing critical details in error messages or network interface details that could provide a potential security vulnerability.
