### Function overview

The `node_storage_manager` function manages storage components on a node. By using two main arguments, a component and an action, it decides which storage management function to call. The user can also optionally pass further arguments for specific storage management tasks. Component options include "lio" and "zvol," corresponding to different subsystems in the node's storage system. Actions can include operations like 'start', 'stop', 'status', etc. The function validates the arguments, dispatches to the appropriate function based on the given component, logs the execution and handles any errors.

### Technical description

***node_storage_manager***

- **Description**: This function manages storage components for a machine node. It logs an error and returns 1 if any of the main arguments is missing. The function then checks the value of the 'component' argument and calls the corresponding function for 'lio' or 'zvol'. If the 'component' argument doesn't match any of these, it logs an error and returns 1. The function then captures the exit status of the called function, logs a respective message and returns the result.
- **Globals**: None
- **Arguments**: 
    - `$1`: The component to manage. Can either be 'lio' or 'zvol'.
    - `$2`: The action to execute on the given component.
    - `...`: Optional arguments passed to the dispatched function.
- **Outputs**: Logs messages to the remote log regarding the action being performed, its success or failure, and its return code.
- **Returns**: 0 if the dispatched function was successful, 1 if the arguments are invalid or the dispatched function failed.
- **Example usage**: `node_storage_manager lio start`

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Refrain from passing sensitive data as arguments or using them in log messages.
2. Add more detailed error logging to help with troubleshooting potential errors.
3. Add input sanitization to the function to prevent possible shell injection attacks.
4. Consider adding more explicit validation logic for argument values to catch common user input errors.
5. Be sure that called functions 'node_lio_manage' and 'node_zvol_manage' are implemented securely and robustly.
6. Protect all logging data, especially if it contains sensitive information.
7. Use specific return codes for different errors to help users better understand why the function failed.
8. Document any modifications made to the function for clarity.
