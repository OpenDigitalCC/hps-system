### Function overview
The bash function `n_disable_getty_alpine` is designed to disable the getty service in Alpine Linux, which is used for signing onto a terminal. Getty is disabled to setup a custom console display. The function primarily logs the disabling process, creates a copy of the original `inittab` file for backup, and modifies the `inittab` file to remove getty. It then adds a custom console display script and instructs the init process to reload. Finally, a late startup script is removed as its execution is now handled by `inittab`.
