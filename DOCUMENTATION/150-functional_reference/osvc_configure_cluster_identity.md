Contained in `lib/functions.d/opensvc-functions.sh`

Function signature: 1f5c78a106d5bed621fe281cceb1a8daa04bf12c433437185fe19c7e31f0192d

### Function Overview

The `osvc_configure_cluster_identity()` function is used to configure the identity of an OpenSVC cluster. It waits for the socket to be ready, checks if the daemon is responsive, retrieves the cluster name and heartbeat type, and applies the configuration updates. It also records these stages in logs. If any stage fails, it records the error in the logs and the function stops. The function returns `0` if the process is successful and `1` if it encounters an error.

### Technical Description

- **Name**: `osvc_configure_cluster_identity()` 
- **Description**: This function configures the identity of an OpenSVC (open source virtual clustering) cluster.
- **Globals**: [ `i`: Iterator for a loop from 1 to 10, `cluster_name`: Name of the cluster, `hb_type`: Cluster heartbeat type ]
- **Arguments**: None
- **Outputs**: Informational and error logs throughout the process. Final log provides cluster identity, including name and heartbeat type. 
- **Returns**: 0 if the configuration process is successful, 1 if an error is encountered.
- **Example Usage**: `osvc_configure_cluster_identity`

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. The function should have error handling for when the socket is not ready after 10 seconds. Currently, the function would proceed further even in this scenario.
2. The function should check the existence of the cluster, before trying to configure its identity.
3. The function should validate the cluster_name and heartbeat type before using them.
4. The unchecked use of globals can be risky. These should be validated or handled locally within the function.
5. Ensure that error logging is detailed enough to troubleshoot potential problems. Sensitive information, however, should not be included in logs to prevent security risks.
6. To prevent potential errors, consider setting default values for the cluster_name and heartbeat type if they are not set or invalid.
7. Consider adding more extensive testing to cover all aspects of this function to ensure it behaves as expected.
