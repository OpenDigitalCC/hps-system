Function signature: abe6f9e3a232a393f27bf444712eae8038b19089d61694e69a5f394e185e3f68

### Function Overview

The `n_check_build_dependencies` function is used for checking available build dependencies of a software. It tests the presence of listed commands on the local system. If an unavailable command is detected, it alerts the user and suggests an install command along with adding the name to a list of missing packages that will be logged remotely. If all commands are present, the function returns a success message.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** n_check_build_dependencies
- **Description:** This function checks the presence of required build dependencies by executing each as a command and checking the system's response. The absence of any required command is logged and if any are missing, a command is suggested to install the missing packages.
- **Globals:** None
- **Arguments:** None
- **Outputs:**
    - Prints the status of each required command (Present or Missing).
    - If any packages are missing, prints the names of the missing packages and provides a command to install them.
    - In case of missing commands, logs the missing packages remotely and alerts about the failure of build environment check.
    - If all commands are present, alerts about the successful build environment check.
- **Returns:** Returns 1 if any dependency is missing, 0 if all present.
- **Example usage:**
```
source n_check_build_dependencies.sh
n_check_build_dependencies
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Implement input validation or sanitization to enhance security. For instance, avoid code injection by making sure commands and package names are not injectable.
2. Handle possible cases of failure more effectively. For example, if the internet connection fails during downloading or installation of packages.
3. Consider implementing a way to specify alternative packages for different distributions. This function assumes use of the `apk` package manager which is not available on all distributions.
