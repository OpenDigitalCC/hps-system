Contained in `lib/functions.d/configure-supervisor.sh`

Function signature: 5ead4ebed48cedb7a928e3c048d0d0b546746f48cc20520b8e2cdef5bd83bbad

### Function overview

The function `get_path_supervisord_conf` is designed to output the path to the `supervisord.conf` file within the system's cluster services directory. This function does not take any arguments and solely depends on the functionality of another function (`get_path_cluster_services_dir`), which should ideally return the path to the cluster services directory.

### Technical description

```{.bash}
get_path_supervisord_conf () {
  echo "$(get_path_cluster_services_dir)/supervisord.conf"
}
```

Here are the technical details -

- **name**: `get_path_supervisord_conf`
- **description**: This function outputs the complete path to the `supervisord.conf` file in the cluster services directory. It echo's the result of `get_path_cluster_services_dir` function call concatenated with '/supervisord.conf'.
- **globals**: None.
- **arguments**: None.
- **outputs**: Prints the path to the `supervisord.conf` file.
- **returns**: None, as the function result is directly printed out. 
- **example usage**: 

```{.bash}
get_path_supervisord_conf
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Make sure the `get_path_cluster_services_dir` function is safe and secure. This function's output is directly used here, so any security vulnerabilities in it might affect this function too.
2. The function does not handle the case where the `get_path_cluster_services_dir` might fail or return an error. It is recommended to introduce some error checking to make the function more reliable.
3. The function does not check whether the `supervisord.conf` file is reachable or accessible. Adding this check will improve the reliability of the function.
4. The function does not validate the path string it constructs, making it potentially vulnerable to path traversal or other filesystem-based attacks. Validate and sanitize all outputs from `get_path_cluster_services_dir` function.
5. Ensure the service (or script) that uses the output of this function has proper permissions to access the `supervisord.conf` file. This will prevent possible permission issues at runtime.
