### Function Overview

The function `register_source_file()` has been designed to register a source file to an index within a specific destination directory. This function takes in a filename and handler as inputs and if any duplicate is avoided, it proceeds to register the file and its handler to the index file located in the destination directory. The function also provides feedback on successful registration or if the file is already registered.

### Technical Description

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Validate the inputs: Make sure both filename and handler are not empty or null before proceeding with the registration process.
2. Error handling: Add error catching mechanisms to handle unexpected situations such as issues with directory creation or file writing.
3. Secure Files: Ensure that the permissions for both the index file and directory are set appropriately to prevent unauthorized access.
4. Logging: Introduce detailed logging in each step for easier debugging and traceability.
