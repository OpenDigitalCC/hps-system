Function signature: 4e8d2d80a56db706bb5ebb500956281db15dd8b0c1afadab8b2a07d2b711d176

### Function Overview

The `n_get_provisioning_node` function is tasked with the responsibility of returning the IP of the default gateway, in other words, the provisioning node. It achieves this functionality using a combination of the `ip route` command to get the IP routing table and the AWK text processing language to parse the output of the command and extract the required field.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** n_get_provisioning_node
- **Description:** This function retrieves and returns the default gateway IP in the IP routing table, which is the provisioning node.
- **Globals:** None, this function does not utilize or modify any global variables.
- **Arguments:** This function does not accept any arguments, as it retrieves data from the system directly.
- **Outputs:** The function prints the IP address of the default gateway to stdout.
- **Returns:** The function does not have a return value as such since it directly prints to the stdout. However, if we consider the printed IP as the return, it returns the default gateway IP.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```bash
  gateway_ip=$(n_get_provisioning_node)
  echo "The default gateway (provisioning node) is $gateway_ip"
  ```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. To improve quality, the function could handle errors or unexpected outputs from the `ip route` command which may not contain expected default route information.
2. Enhance security by validating and sanitizing the IP before returning it. This could prevent any potential command injection attack if the function output is used elsewhere.
3. Enhance readability and portability of the function by using full command paths, avoiding command shortcuts and by commenting the code more thoroughly.
4. Future versions of this function could consider accepting the interface name as an argument so that it can work in environments with multiple network interfaces.
