### Function overview

The `n_queue_run()` command is a Bash function that reads from a defined queue file (`N_QUEUE_FILE`) and executes the functions listed in that file. It provides feedback on the number of queued functions, execution progress, success or failure of function execution, total execution time for each function, and final execution results (total successes and failures). This function also logs execution steps and results to a remote log using `n_remote_log()`.

### Technical description

**Function Information:**
- **Name:** `n_queue_run`
- **Description:** Executes functions listed in a queue file. Outputs execution details (i.e., success, failure, execution time) and manages queue clearing.
- **Globals:** `N_QUEUE_FILE`: The file containing the queue of functions to be executed.
- **Arguments:** No direct arguments are used in this function.
- **Outputs:** Sends execution details to standard output and/or console, including total queued functions, start of execution, per function execution progress, success or failure status, execution time for each function, and final execution results.
- **Returns:** Returns the number of failed functions.
- **Example Usage:** `n_queue_run`

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Utilize absolute file paths for `N_QUEUE_FILE` to avoid unnecessary complications or potential security issues.
2. It is recommended to ensure proper permissions are set for the queue file. This prevents unauthorized access or manipulation of the queue.
3. Code logic could be reviewed to ensure that only known-good functions from the queue are executed.
4. Consider implementing error checking or handling for situations when `n_remote_log()` fails.
5. It's encouraged to sanitize and validate the function call from the queue before `eval` to prevent potential security risks.
6. Consider surrounding the `eval "${func_call}"` operation with exception handling or error-checking mechanism to gracefully handle any potential errors or exceptions that might occur during the function calls.
7. Logging could be enhanced by including date-time stamps, severity levels, and more actionable messages for troubleshooting.
