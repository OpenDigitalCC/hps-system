### Function overview

The function `get_active_cluster_name()` is a shell function that retrieves the name of the currently active cluster by utilizing other helper functions. It sets the `dir` variable as the active cluster directory obtained from `get_active_cluster_dir` function. Once the directory is obtained, it retrieves only the last segment from the pathname that denotes the active cluster's name.

### Technical description

**Name:** `get_active_cluster_name()`

**Description:** This function retrieves the name of the active cluster from the cluster directory's path. It uses the `get_active_cluster_dir` function to get the active directory first, then leverages the `basename` utility to retrieve the active cluster's name.

**Globals:** None

**Arguments:** None

**Outputs:** The active cluster's name.

**Returns:** It returns 0 on successful execution and 1 if the `get_active_cluster_dir` function fails to execute.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
active_cluster=$(get_active_cluster_name)
echo "Active cluster is: $active_cluster"
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Always quote your variable expansions. For instance, `basename -- "$dir"`.
2. In this function, the `get_active_cluster_dir` function is used, but it cannot handle the case if the function isn't defined. Error handling for this use case should be taken into account.
3. Avoid globals as much as possible as they can produce unpredictable side effects, which can be difficult to debug and maintain.
4. Validate user-defined inputs for security concerns to prevent injection attacks.
5. Write comments for your functions and complex code sections for better readability and maintainability.
6. Always consider edge cases while writing the function. For example, if there is no active cluster, the function should handle this scenario gracefully.
7. Writing unit tests for the functions is a good practice to ensure that they work as expected.  It helps to detect function errors, gaps, or missing requirements.
