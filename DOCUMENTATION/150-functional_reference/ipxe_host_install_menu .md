### Function overview

The function `ipxe_host_install_menu` is designed to provide a tool for network booting, offering several options for configuration. These options range from the installation of thin compute hosts, storage cluster hosts, to disaster recovery hosts, with or without specific profiles. Users have the freedom to choose the profile they want with their hostname. The function utilizes iPixie's shell scripting environment to create these options, gathering valuable system information and event logging in the process.

### Technical description

- Name: ipxe_host_install_menu
- Description: The function creates an installation option menu for users to configure their host settings in regards to Thin Compute Host, Storage Cluster Host, or Disaster Recovery Hosts. It then logs the selected menu, and processes the menu item.
- Globals: None.
- Arguments: This function does not directly take in any arguments. However, variables like TITLE_PREFIX, FUNCNAME, CGI_URL, mac are processed internally within the function.
- Outputs: An install menu with log message and selection options.
- Returns: No return value as it's not needed in bash scripting, but it generates a host install menu for users to interact with which is the intended effect.
- Example usage:
  ```bash
  ipxe_host_install_menu
  ```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Input Validation: Validate input from users when configuring their hosts to ensure they are within permissible and expected values to avoid unforeseen issues.
2. Error Handling: Although the function attempts to log when a failure occurs (i.e., `echo Log failed`), significantly more robust error handling could be beneficial. This can include implementing logging for all failure points or at least planning for recovery or alternative steps for when failures occur.
3. Security Improvements: Avoid the exposure of sensitive data in log messages. For example, IP addresses, host identifiers, or any potentially exploitable system information.
4. Documentation and Comments: Include proper in-line comments to provide a better understanding of the script. Furthermore, each argument, even if supplied indirectly, should have a detailed explanation, making the script more maintainable and understandable to other developers.
