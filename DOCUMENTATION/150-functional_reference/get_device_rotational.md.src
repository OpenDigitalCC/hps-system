### Function overview

The `get_device_rotational()` function in Bash is designed to fetch the rotational status of the specified device. This status is derived from the `sysfs` filesystem and signals whether the device uses rotational storage media (like a traditional hard drive) or not (like an SSD). If the function is unable to retrieve this information, it defaults to returning `"1"`.

### Technical description

- **Name**: `get_device_rotational()`
- **Description**: This function fetches and prints the rotational status of a specific block device. '1' implies the device uses rotational media, while '0' indicates use of non-rotational media.
- **Globals**: None.
- **Arguments**: `$1: dev` â€” The device whose rotational status is to be fetched.
- **Outputs**: The rotational status ('1' or '0') of the specified device.
- **Returns**: Nothing.
- **Example Usage**: `get_device_rotational sda`

  In the example above, '`sda`' is the block device for which the rotational status is desired.

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Consider using more descriptive variable names to improve code readability.
2. Remember to properly quote your variables to avoid word-splitting or pathname expansion.
3. Always use `#!/bin/bash` or `#!/usr/bin/env bash` for writing bash scripts, not `#!/bin/sh`, because it may not actually link to `bash` on many systems, leading to unexpected behavior.
4. You should check if the device path exists in the sys filesystem as a preliminary step before attempting to fetch the rotational status.
5. Consider error handling for cases where the provided device name does not exist.
