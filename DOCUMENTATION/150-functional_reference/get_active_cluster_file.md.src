### Technical description

**Definition:**

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Include more error handling for situations where file does not exist or it fails to be read by cat command.
2. Ensure that the file reading process is secure and its contents are not accessible to unauthorized users. This can be achieved by setting appropriate permissions on the file.
3. Sanitize output to minimize the potential impact of malicious data.
4. The function should not trust the file's content blindly, it should validate the input before processing it. This is important to prevent possible code injection flaws.
5. Include a more comprehensive documentation, specifying what the function expects as an input and output. This will be beneficial for users of the function. Keep improving the unit tests aiming at improved code coverage.
