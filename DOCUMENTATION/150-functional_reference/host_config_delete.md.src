Function signature: 879c4c1c59478ffcfd437a6d710d463fd2811a08a4bc4f57d5dd6d62b5a37709

### Function Overview 
The `host_config_delete` function is designed to validate and delete configuration file associated with a provided MAC address. It uses a helper function `get_host_conf_filename` to determine the config file path. If the MAC address or config file are not found, or if the file deletion fails, it logs an error and returns an appropriate error code.

### Technical Description
***Name:***  
 `host_config_delete`

***Description:***  
This function deletes the configuration file for a provided MAC address. It logs error messages in case the MAC address is not provided, config file location cannot be determined, and deletion fails.

***Globals:***  
- `__HOST_CONFIG_MAC`: Stores the last valid MAC address  
- `__HOST_CONFIG_PARSED`: Indicates if parsed files are available  
- `__HOST_CONFIG_FILE`: Stores host_config file path

***Arguments:***  
- `$1`: The MAC address

***Outputs:***  
Logs messages to indicate success or failure of operations. 

***Returns:***  
- 0: If deletion is successful.
- 1: If MAC address is not provided or config file location cannot be determined.
- 2: If the config file doesn't exist.
- 3: If deletion fails.

***Example usage:***  
```bash
host_config_delete "00:14:22:01:23:45"
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. Improve error logging framework: The error messages could be improved by providing more details about the failures.
2. Properly handle globals: Globals can lead to hard-to-trace bugs and reduce testability. Avoid globals when possible, and instead use function returns and arguments.
3. Potential race conditions: As the function checks for file existence and then deletes it, there could be a race condition if another process deletes the file after the check but before the delete. To prevent this, the function could catch and handle the error case where the file doesn't exist at removal stage, rather than checking file existence in advance.
4. Return comprehensive status codes: A dedicated error code should be provided for each unique error case to enhance maintainability and troubleshooting.
