### Function Overview

The `check_available_space` function is used to determine whether there is enough available disk space at a given path. The path to be checked is passed to the function as an argument, along with a specified amount of required space in megabytes. If no amount is specified, the function defaults to checking for at least 500MB of available space.

### Technical Description

- **Name**: `check_available_space`
- **Description**: This function verifies if enough disk space is available at a given path. The amount of required disk space can optionally be passed as an argument. If not provided, it defaults to checking for 500MB.
- **Globals**: None
- **Arguments**: 
  - `$1`: Path to the directory for disk space check. This is a mandatory argument.
  - `$2`: The required disk space in MB. This is an optional argument, if not provided defaults to 500MB.
- **Outputs**: 
  - Outputs available disk space in MB at the given path to `stdout`.
  - Logs error messages to `stderr` using `hps_log` if thereâ€™s an error.
- **Returns**: 
  - Returns 0 if the available space is greater than or equal to the required space OR if the path exists and available space can be determined.
  - Returns 1 if the available space is less than the required space OR if the path does not exist or available space cannot be determined.
- **Example usage**:
  - `check_available_space /path/to/directory 1000`: Checks if the directory at /path/to/directory has at least 1000MB of available space.

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. The function currently relies on the availability and behavior of external commands such as `df`, `awk`, and `sed`. The reliance on these commands might introduce potential vulnerabilities and room for behavior inconsistencies across different systems. It is recommended to reduce this dependence by using built-in Bash features wherever possible.
2. Consider adding more comprehensive error handling to deal with situations like the absence of utilities the function depends on.
3. To enhance readability and maintainability, consider refactoring lengthy operations into separate, smaller functions.
4. The function could benefit from input validation. Currently, there is no validation that the required parameters (path and required space) are of the correct format or within plausible ranges.
5. Ensure the function is thoroughly tested with various inputs, including edge and failure cases.
6. Document any assumptions made in the code and any system dependencies.
7. Consider using a static analysis tool to detect potential security vulnerabilities and to enforce a coding standard.
