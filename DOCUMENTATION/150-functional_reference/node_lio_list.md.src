### Function overview

The `node_lio_list` is a Bash function that lists out iSCSI targets and block backstores from a system. The function leverages the `targetcli` command for pulling and organizing the required information, thus providing an easy and direct interface for iSCSI and backstore management.

### Technical description

**Name:** `node_lio_list`

**Description:** The function retrieves and displays the iSCSI targets and block backstores present in the system by using the `targetcli` command. It showcases the results one after the other for ease of visibility and understanding.

**Globals:** None

**Arguments:** None

**Outputs:** The function prints two lists. The first list displays the iSCSI Targets. This segment of the program executes the `targetcli` command to get the iSCSI targets. After a line break, the second list displays the block backstores also using the `targetcli` command.

**Returns:** It returns `0` after executing the `echo` commands to signify that the function executed successfully.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
node_lio_list
```

### Quality and security recommendations
1. The function is relatively simple and does not handle errors. Users should be aware that any errors occurring in the `targetcli` command will break the function. Proper error handling should be considered to ensure resilience of the function.
2. The use of global variables could be considered for more customized output.
3. While not a problem in this specific function, keep in mind that usage of `echo` to output data can lead to potential command injection if user-provided data is not properly sanitized.
4. Always review your Bash scripts for potential security vulnerabilities. This could include examining how it handles input, reviewing the script for potential command injection vulnerabilities, and checking the script for insecure file operations.
5. Use helper functions to make the code reusable and modular. The function should do one thing and do it well. This function is a good example of that.
