### Function Overview

The `create_iscsi_target` is a bash function primarily used for creating an iSCSI target on a remote host. iSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface) is an Internet Protocol-based storage networking standard for linking data storage facilities. The function receives three parameters: remote hosts, IP (default is 0.0.0.0), and port (default is 3260). It uses these to create an iSCSI target which exposes block-level storage for use by other networked servers, leveraging the `targetcli` command to perform the actual operations. It also checks for required iSCSI prerequisites before proceeding.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** create_iscsi_target
- **Description:** Creates an iSCSI target at the specified remote host using the provided IP and port.
- **Globals:** None
- **Arguments:** 
  - `$1: remote_host` - The hostname of the remote machines
  - `$2: ip` - The IP to create the iSCSI target on. Default is 0.0.0.0.
  - `$3: port` - The port to use for the iSCSI target. Default is 3260.
- **Outputs:** Prints out messages about the status of the iSCSI target creation.
- **Returns:** 1 if the remote host is not specified or iSCSI target prerequisites are not met; otherwise, the exit status of the last command executed.
- **Example usage:** `create_iscsi_target my-host 192.168.1.100 3260`

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Since this function does privileged operations, ensure that it's only run by authorized users or services. Implement proper authorization checks to prevent unwanted usage.
2. Validate input parameters to ensure they are of correct format and within expected ranges. This helps avoid possible command injection vulnerabilities.
3. Handle errors and exceptions appropriately. Right now, if anything fails, the function would just continue with the remaining commands which might lead to inconsistent results.
4. Consider the implications of not using any encryption in your iSCSI traffic. Use IPSec or similarly secure tunneling protocols if this traffic traverses untrusted networks.
5. Consider limiting access to the iSCSI targets from trusted initiator IPs only, to prevent unauthorized accesses.
