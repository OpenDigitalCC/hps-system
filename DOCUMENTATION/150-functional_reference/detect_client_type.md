Function signature: a5996dd77379049ae4564d5c7eaab09a5189d239c610eea12c0d452cd96097e7

### Function Overview

The function `detect_client_type()` is designed to determine the type of client making a request and echo it back. The function looks at both the query string and the user agent to make this determination. If the client type cannot be determined, it echoes back "unknown".

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `detect_client_type()`
- **Description:** Determines the type of the client from `$QUERY_STRING` or `$HTTP_USER_AGENT`. This function echoes the client type: 'ipxe', 'cli', 'browser', 'script' or 'unknown' if it can't determine the client type.
- **Globals:** 
  - `QUERY_STRING`: Utilized to determine the client type based on the presence of certain keywords. If not set, default value is an empty string.
  - `HTTP_USER_AGENT`: Utilized to determine the client type based on the presence of certain keywords. If not set, default value is an empty string.
- **Arguments:** The function does not accept any arguments.
- **Outputs:** Echoes the type of client making the request.
- **Returns:** Always returns 0 as the function is designed to not fail, falling back to a default output of "unknown" when necessary.
- **Example Usage:** 
```
$ export QUERY_STRING="via=cli"
$ detect_client_type
cli
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. To reduce potential errors or misuse, explicitly document the environments and contexts in which this function should be used or not used.
2. Consider adding error handling for undesired or unexpected input to improve stability.
3. Make sure to sanitize user-generated inputs such as query strings to prevent injection attacks.
4. If feasible, add type checks for input values in cases where the function starts accepting arguments.
5. To prevent leakage of potentially sensitive information, use discretion with echoing data, especially if it includes data from HTTP headers in a web server environment.
