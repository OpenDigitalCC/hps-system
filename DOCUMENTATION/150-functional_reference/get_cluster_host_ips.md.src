### Function overview

The `get_cluster_host_ips` function is responsible for retrieving the IP addresses of hosts in a specified cluster. The function takes a single argument, which is the name of the cluster to retrieve host IPs from. If no argument is provided, the function attempts to use the directory of the active cluster. The function works by iterating over the configuration files for each host in the directory of the specified cluster, extracting and outputting the IP address of each host.

### Technical description

- **Name**: `get_cluster_host_ips`
- **Description**: This function retrieves the IP addresses for hosts in a specified cluster. If no cluster is specified, it defaults to the active one.
- **Globals**: None explicitly used in the function.
- **Arguments**: 
  - `$1: cluster_name:` The name of the cluster from which to retrieve the list of hosts and their IP addresses.
- **Outputs**: List of IP addresses of all hosts in the specified or active cluster.
- **Returns**:
  - `1`: If it cannot determine the hosts directory.
  - `0`: Successfully retrieves the IP addresses.
- **Example usage**:
```
$ get_cluster_host_ips my_cluster
192.168.1.1
192.168.1.2
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Perform validation on the argument: The function should verify whether the provided argument is a valid cluster name or not.
2. Error handling enhancements: The function could also benefit from more robust error handling, for example by making sure that the `grep`, `cut`, and `tr` commands are successful.
3. Security enhancements: Be aware that if an attacker can manipulate the content of host's configuration files, they may be able to inject malicious data. Ensure only authorized personnel can modify these files.
4. Additional return codes: Implement more specific return codes that can indicate various failure points within the function for easier troubleshooting.
5. Documentation: Comment on any global variables and their usage within the function for clarity.
