### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. When using the rm -f command, ensure that you have write permissions for the files or directories you want to delete. Failure to do so may result in unexpected behavior or errors.
2. Make sure variable N_QUEUE_FILE is well defined and does not refer to any critical system files.
3. Always keep a backup of important data. Even if a rm -f command is executed by mistake, a backup can save you from data loss.
4. Implement error handling inside the function to deal with potential problems, such as the absence of the file to be deleted. 
5. Consider using more meaningful variable names for N_QUEUE_FILE to make your code easier to understand by other developers.
