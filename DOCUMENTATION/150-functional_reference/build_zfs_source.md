Function signature: 6c2e11707d627f033ec6c0466cd422c8739078f93ea989430f8a0a9c0187dac0

### Function Overview

The `build_zfs_source` function is a default, non-distro-specific function that is part of a build system for ZFS, a complex file system used in Linux environments. This function logs the build, alerts the user that this system requires its own ZFS build process through a local system configuration file, and finally returns an error status.

### Technical Description

- Name: build_zfs_source
- Description: This function logs a message that a ZFS build process is not distro-specific. It then echoes a message to the user informing them that this system must implement its own ZFS build process via a local system configuration file. Finally, it returns with an error status of 1.
- Globals: None
- Arguments: None
- Outputs: The outputs from this function include a log message indicating that the default, non-distro-specific ZFS source build process is running, and an echo message to the user that this system must implement its ZFS build process with the local system configuration file.
- Returns: The function returns 1, an error status.
- Example usage:  
```bash
build_zfs_source
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Error messages should be more explicit: it would be more user-friendly to supply the filepath of where the local system configuration file is expected to be, or hints on how to create it.
2. Log outputs should also include the date and time of the function execution, for effective tracking and system management.
3. Consider implementing a helper function that checks if the local system configuration file exists and is appropriately configured before attempting to build the ZFS source. This would prevent incorrect configurations and save system resources.
4. All echoed or logged outputs should ideally be sanitized to prevent injection attacks if these elements are displayed in a web interface or stored in a database.
5. Consider implementing a default ZFS build process within the function if a local system configuration is not found to enhance the robustness of the system.
