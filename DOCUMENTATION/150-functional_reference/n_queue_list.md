### Function Overview

The `n_queue_list` function serves as a method to list all the pending function calls in queue. It first verifies if a file, containing the queue of functions, exists and if not, outputs a message stating "No functions queued". If such file exists, it calculates the total number of lines (functions), and if no functions are found, it again outputs a similar message. In case any function calls are queued, it prints all of them sequentially. The function will always return 0 indicating the successful execution of the function.

### Technical Description
``` 
- Name: n_queue_list
- Description: This function is used to list all the pending function calls. It checks if a file named `N_QUEUE_FILE` exists. If not, it outputs "No functions queued". If the file does exist, it counts the number of functions in queue and lists them. The function always returns 0.
- Globals: [ N_QUEUE_FILE: This variable holds the name of the file which contains the functions ]
- Arguments: None
- Outputs: If any function calls are queued, it will output the list of all these calls. If no calls are queued or if this respective file doesn't exist, it will output "No functions queued"
- Returns: It always returns 0 indicating the function has executed successfully.
- Example usage: 
    n_queue_list

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Always make sure that access to `N_QUEUE_FILE` is properly secured to avoid any possible breach by potential attackers.
2. Check if input data is as expected or sanitized, reducing the possibility of code injection.
3. Make sure that file operations are handled properly in order to avoid errors.
4. Error outputs and return statements should be handled properly in case the queuing file fails to open or doesn't exist.
5. Try to make the function more universal, meaning, it should be able to handle more diverse cases.
