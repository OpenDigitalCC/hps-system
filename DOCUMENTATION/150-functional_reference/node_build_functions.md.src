### Function overview

The `node_build_functions` function is designed to help to build the configuration for a particular `node` for a given `distro`. This script is a part of larger deployment strategy that makes use of a library of pre-defined scripts combined with a build configuration specific to a particular host.

The main purpose of the function is to automate the process of selecting and including various pre-existing scripts that define certain functionality, and build a specific configuration bundle for a particular `distro`. It does so by sweeping through predefined directories and scripts, executes relevant build scripts and increments file count as it includes each file.

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Utilize a more comprehensive error handling system. Though the script has basic error handling and logs information, having more specific error handlers will increase the robustness of the script.
2. Employ a standardized naming convention and file structures for scripts to promote maintainability of the code.
3. Perform more thorough validation of incoming arguments, including a check for the existence of directories and files.
4. Carefully manage the assignment and usage of global variables to avoid conflicts and ensure coherence throughout the script's runtime.
5. Implement a script usage function that can demonstrate the correct use of the function if called incorrectly.
6. Utilize a consistent logging level throughout all scripts for providing comprehensive debug information for troubleshooting.
