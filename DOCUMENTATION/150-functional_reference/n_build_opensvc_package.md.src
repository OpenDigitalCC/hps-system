Function signature: 22c7385e472169b5941896aee8c618de46e294a277f781fa9db14d57d7bcef04

### Function Overview

The `n_build_opensvc_package` function is an advanced installer script function designed to download, compile, and package the OpenSVC software into APK packages for Alpine Linux. OpenSVC is an open source project for managing and orchestrating heterogeneous application stacks within datacenters. 

This function accepts several optional command-line parameters, including the Alpine version, specific OpenSVC git tag, and an option to keep the build directory after the process completes. 

Without these, the function auto-detects the Alpine version and selects the latest compatible OpenSVC version based on the installed Go version. 

### Technical Description

**Name:** `n_build_opensvc_package`

**Description:** This function downloads, compiles, and packages the OpenSVC software into an Alpine APK package. Run it on a system with network connectivity, and adjust the target Alpine version, the OpenSVC version, or whether to keep the build directory via command-line arguments.

**Globals:** 

- `alpine_version`: Target Alpine version (auto-detects if not specified)
- `om3_version`: Specific OpenSVC git tag (Chooses the latest compatible version if not specified)
- `keep_build`: Flag to keep the build directory after the process completes.
- `source_dir`: The source directory where the script will clone the OpenSVC repository.

**Arguments:** 

- `$1`: Options: `--alpine_version`, `--om3_version`, `--keep_build`, `--help`
- `$2`: If $1 is `--alpine_version` or `--om3_version`, $2 should be the version or tag.

**Outputs:** 

- Echoes build steps and relevant status information throughout execution
- In the case of a successful build, the script produces APK packages in the build directory.

**Returns:** 

- `0` on successful execution and completion of all build tasks
- `1` on failure or error

**Example Usage:**

```bash
$ n_build_opensvc_package --alpine_version v3.7 --om3_version 2.0 --keep_build
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. In the `--help` section, expand the option descriptions for better understanding of the function capabilities. 
2. Use safer constructs for argument parsing, such as `getops`, which provides more robustness and flexibility.
3. Apply proper error handling. Instead of only exiting with `return 1` upon errors, it would be beneficial to give more varied return codes depending on the error type.
4. Provide a logging system that logs notable events and possible errors.
5. Where feasible, avoid running the script as root to minimize potential security risks.
6. Keep all code up to date with the latest safe practices and actively audit & review the code, patching any discovered insecurities.
