Function signature: 5f79fe5e7a4a7d3eb591b9e371a140f9bd1de60abf5e87d0e47082bfff056191

### Function Overview
The function `_supervisor_append_once` is designed to modify the settings for Supervisor, a control system for UNIX-based servers. It takes two arguments—`stanza` and `block`. The function checks the supervisor configuration file, which is determined by the environment variable `${SUPERVISORD_CONF}`. If the stated `stanza` is not present in the configuration file, it then appends the corresponding `block` at the end of the file. This function is used multiple times subsequently in the script to ensure Supervisor is configured to securely and efficiently manage various service programs.

### Technical Description
- **Name**: `_supervisor_append_once`
- **Description**: This function appends configuration blocks to the Supervisor configuration file for a specified service program, but only if that block does not already exist. It is used in managing UNIX based servers.
- **Globals**: [`${SUPERVISORD_CONF}`: Path to the Supervisor configuration file]
- **Arguments**: 
  - `$1`: `stanza`— the name of the service program, e.g. `program:nginx`
  - `$2`: `block`— the complete configuration string to be appended. 

- **Outputs**: Appends a configuration block to the Supervisor configuration file for a specific service program.
- **Returns**: Nothing.
- **Example Usage**: `_supervisor_append_once "program:dnsmasq" "$(cat <<EOF`
    - This usage of the function appends dnsmasq related configurations to the Supervisor configuration file.

### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. Enhance error handling to prevent the potential mishandling of non-existent files.
2. Introduce a mechanism to backup the original configuration file before making changes to it.
3. Expand on arguments validation by checking for empty or null arguments.
4. Since shell scripts are susceptible to injection attacks, consider potential sanitization steps for the `stanza` and `block` variables.
5. Avoid hard coding paths and consider converting them into arguments or environment variables to improve scalability.
