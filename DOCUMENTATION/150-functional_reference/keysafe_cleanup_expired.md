Function signature: 3206e50a2d55d74e70a68067e5cb3e041c93edf9f4d93411da00ecaa4c3535d8

### Function overview

The `keysafe_cleanup_expired` function iterates through the files (referred to as tokens) in a specific directory, detects the expired ones, removes them, and logs the number of removed tokens. This function is part of a larger system (possibly a key or token management system) where tokens have finite lifetimes and need to be cleaned up once they expire to prevent stale data accumulation.

### Technical description

- **Name**: `keysafe_cleanup_expired`
- **Description**: This function cleans up expired tokens. It gets the directory where the tokens are stored, iterates through all tokens, and removes the ones that have expired. Upon completion, it logs the count of tokens that were removed.
- **Globals**: None.
- **Arguments**: None.
- **Outputs**: If any tokens were removed, it logs to STDERR in the following format: "Cleaned up [count] expired token(s)". Here [count] is the number of removed tokens.
- **Returns**: 0 (upon successful completion), 1 (in case of failure to obtain the token directory)
- **Example usage**:

  ```bash
  keysafe_cleanup_expired
  ```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. The function should handle errors in a more robust way. Currently, if it fails to get the keysafe directory, it merely returns 1. However, there aren't any checks or exception handling afterward.
2. Security-wise, it's crucial to validate whether the function has the necessary permissions to manipulate the token files (read, delete).
3. The function leverages arbitrary file inclusion with the 'source' command, which can lead to security issues if arbitrary user input can influence the files that are included.
4. It's recommended to implement some form of logging that indicates the exact tokens (files) that were cleaned up.
5. It's useful to sanitize any inputs and consider potential race conditions in circumstances where tokens might be added or removed by other processes while this function executes.
