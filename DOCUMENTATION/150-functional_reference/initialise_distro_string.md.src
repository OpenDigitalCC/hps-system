### Quality and security recommendations

1. Include error handling: If the `/etc/os-release` file doesn't exist or can't be accessed, it would be prudent to add error handling logic to the function and notify the user.
2. Validate variables before usage: To ensure only expected values are used, add sanity checks for the variables.
3. Use more strict condition checks: The function currently considers any existing `/etc/os-release` file as valid. Not just its presence, but also the correctness of its format should be checked.
4. Document the function: The function would benefit from inline comments explaining the logic, and a block comment giving a brief overview of the function and its usage.
5. Use underscore in function name: Using underscore (`_`) between words instead of camel case (`camelCase`) make function names more readable in bash script.
