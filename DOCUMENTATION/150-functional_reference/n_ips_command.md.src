### Function Overview

The `n_ips_command` function is a utility to send a POST request to an access point. The request will target the `boot_manager.sh` script hosted on the access point HTTP server. The requested command and parameters are embedded in the URL.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `n_ips_command`
- **Description:** Send a POST request to the IP address fetched from a function `n_get_provisioning_node` directing towards `boot_manager.sh` script as a part of the URL. The function sends command as URL parameters and catches HTTP errors and Curl errors, providing error handling. Output from the curl command is parsed and HTTP error codes are checked. In case of no errors, the HTTP response is echoed.

- **Outputs:** Either `N_IPS_COMMAND_LAST_ERROR` and `N_IPS_COMMAND_LAST_RESPONSE` assigned with error codes and HTTP response upon failure, or HTTP response itself upon success.
- **Returns:** Error codes upon HTTP or curl errors or 0 upon successful HTTP request.
- **Example usage:** `n_ips_command "print" key=value anotherkey=anothervalue`

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Include more descriptive error messages for easier debugging.
2. Secure the POST request by adding some form of authentication to prevent unauthorized access.
3. SSL/TLS could be utilized to add encryption to the communication.
4. Better handle potential edge-cases, avoid possible command injection by escaping special characters.
5. Make error codes consistent or adjustable through variables to maintain compatibility and flexibility if used in larger workflow.
