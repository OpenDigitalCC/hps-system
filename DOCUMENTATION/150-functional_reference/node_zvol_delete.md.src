Function signature: 21fe8b803dc5e01613ebe91d459c8ff30011593e6a87412bc6122f867aeec227

### Function overview
The `node_zvol_delete` function is designed to handle the deletion of ZFS volumes (`zvol`). The function accepts two parameters: the name of the ZFS storage pool and the name of the specific volume. It first checks whether these parameters have been provided or not. If they are missing, it will return an error message and exit. If they are provided, it will construct the path to the ZFS volume and then check whether that volume exists. If it doesnâ€™t, it will return an error message and exit. If it does, it will attempt to delete the volume and return a success message if successful or an error message if not.

### Technical description
The following properties describe the function in a technical manner:

- **Name:** `node_zvol_delete`
- **Description:** Deletes a node's ZFS volume
- **Globals:** None
- **Inputs:**
  - `--pool`: The pool parameter (a type of ZFS storage)
  - `--name`: The name of the volume to be deleted
- **Outputs:** Messages indicating the process of deletion and its success or failure
- **Returns:** 
  - `0` if the volume is successfully deleted
  - `1` if there's an error (either because of missing parameters or failure in deletion)
- **Example usage:**
```
node_zvol_delete --pool mypool --name myvolume
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Add more in-depth input validation for both `--pool` and `--name` parameters to ensure they conform to expected formats or value ranges.
2. Implement error handling that doesn't merely log and return but also performs some sort of troubleshooting or recovery operation.
3. Consider adding an optional force-delete parameter to allow bypassing certain checks when necessary.
4. Ensure that all output messages, especially error messages, do not leak sensitive system state information.
5. Implement strict access control measures to protect against unauthorized zfs pool and volume deletion.
