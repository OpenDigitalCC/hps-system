### Function overview

The function `hps_configure_opensvc_cluster` is designed to configure an OpenSVC cluster. It waits for the daemon's socket to be available and then attempts to configure the cluster's identity. In case of failure configuring the cluster, it logs a warning message. If the daemon socket is not available after repeated checks, cluster configuration is skipped.

### Technical description

- **Name**: `hps_configure_opensvc_cluster`
- **Description**: This function attempts to configure the identity of an OpenSVC cluster by periodically checking for the availability of the daemon's socket.
- **Globals**: None.
- **Arguments**: No arguments required for this function.
- **Outputs**: Logs information about the successful configuration of the OpenSVC cluster or a failure to do so.
- **Returns**: Always returns `0`.
- **Example usage**: `hps_configure_opensvc_cluster`

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Set a maximum number of attempts or a timeout for attempting to configure the cluster to prevent the script from being stuck in an infinite loop if the daemon socket is unavailable.
2. Include additional error handling for specific errors that could be returned when the identity configuration fails.
3. Ensure all log messages include the date and time to assist with potential troubleshooting.
4. Validate that the socket file or path does not contain any unsafe characters or sequences to avoid potential security vulnerabilities.
