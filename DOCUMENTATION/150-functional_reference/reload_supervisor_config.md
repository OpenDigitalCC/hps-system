### Function overview

The `reload_supervisor_config` function is designed to reload the configuration file of the Supervisor process control system. It does this by declaring a path to a configuration file and then using the `supervisorctl` utility to initially read, then subsequently, update the configuration according to the file. The function utilizes logging at each stage to provide visibility of each step and its success.

### Technical description

Name: `reload_supervisor_config`

Description: A function that reads and updates the `supervisord` configuration file, logging the result each time.

Globals: 
- `SUPERVISORD_CONF` - This is used to store the path to the supervisord configuration file. 
- `CLUSTER_SERVICES_DIR` - It's an external global variable used within the `SUPERVISORD_CONF` variable to build the exact path to the configuration file.

Arguments: None

Outputs: Logs information about the success of the reread and update operations.

Returns: None. The function doesn't have explicit return statements.

Example Usage:
```bash
reload_supervisor_config
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Consider providing feedback with more granularity: return an error code when `supervisorctl` commands fail.
2. It is suggested to check if the `supervisorctl` command is available before execution to make sure the command exists and can be executed.
3. The function should have a check for the existence and readability of the configuration file before trying to use it.
4. It might be wise to consider input sanitization of the `CLUSTER_SERVICES_DIR` variable, ensuring it doesn't contain malicious inputs.
5. Ensure that logging does not inadvertently expose sensitive information either in the log statement or the log files. This could include file paths or error messages.
