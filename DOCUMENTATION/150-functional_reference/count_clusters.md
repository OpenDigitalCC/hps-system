Function signature: 35e810345753544ce73618109f16ad97d33b5185c8ff2d374a8837aa569e5960

### Function overview

The `count_clusters` function is a shell command used primarily to gather a count of directories that are considered "clusters". More specifically, it stores these cluster directories into an array and returns the count. If the array is empty, it outputs an error message, and return an exit code of 0 along with a count of 0 to illustrate that no clusters were found.

### Technical description

**Name:** `count_clusters`  
**Description:** This function is used to obtain a count of "cluster" directories.   
**Globals:** `[ HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR: The base directory where clusters are located ]`  
**Arguments:** `[ None ]`  
**Outputs:** If it cannot find any clusters, it outputs an error message stating "No clusters found in 'HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR'". If it finds clusters, it outputs the count of clusters.  
**Returns:** It returns 0 regardless of whether it finds any clusters. If it finds clusters, it still returns the number of clusters.  
**Example Usage:**

``` bash
# Count the directories in the base directory.  
count_clusters  
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Based on the provided function, there's an implication that some global variables are used across multiple functions. This could lead to obscure bugs if one function modifies the global variable in a way that another function doesn't expect. In a safer, clearer, and easier-to-maintain option, those global variables should be turned into arguments to isolate side effects.

2. There is a lack of argument validation in the function. For robust and error-free functioning, it is advisable to check if the calculated directories exist and are indeed directories before counting them.

3. The use of `echo` to communicate errors is not following best practices. Instead, we should consider switching to an logger or exposing error messages through the use of special return codes. This would give users more context on how to resolve the error than just presenting it as a string.
