### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. In order to ensure quality, provide appropriate default values or error messages for empty keys or values.
2. It is critical to verify the successful execution of this function in the program, as its return status is the return status of the `om config set` statement.
3. Always validate key-value pairs before appending to a configuration file, to avoid a potential security risk.
4. Be mindful of potential disk space problems. If the key-value pairs are extremely large, or if they are just very numerous, you could end up filling your disk space.
