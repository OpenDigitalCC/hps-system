Function signature: 25a0229bfcf5422d4fe07f68f0d2261ee643e57fcff68bbc63ba33c0f41af39e

### Function overview

The `get_keysafe_dir` function is used in the Bash shell. This function's role is to return the directory location of the keysafe within an active cluster, checking if the cluster is active, verifying if the keysafe directory exists, and creating it if it does not.

### Technical description

- __Name__: `get_keysafe_dir`
- __Description__: The function checks if a cluster is active by checking if the symlink for the cluster directory exists. If it does not exist, an error is returned. If it does exist, the function resolves the symlink to find the actual location of the active-cluster directory and constructs the keysafe path. It then checks if the 'tokens' directory exists within the keysafe directory. If it does not, the function tries to create it. If it fails to create the directory, it returns another error. If it succeeds or if the directory already exists, it just echoes the keysafe directory path.
- __Globals__: `[ HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR: The base directory path where the cluster configuration directories are stored ]`
- __Arguments__: The function does not take any arguments.
- __Outputs__: Prints the path to the keysafe directory or an error message.
- __Returns__: Success status of function. 0 if successful, 1 if the active cluster symlink does not exist, 2 if failed to create the keysafe directory.
- __Example usage__:
  ```bash
  $ get_keysafe_dir
  /path/to/your/keysafe_dir
  ```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Input Validation: Although there are no direct user inputs to this function, the paths used in the function could be validated for safety, to guard against directory traversal or similar attacks.
2. Error Handling: More detailed error messages could provide more insights about the reasons causing failure, aiding in better debugging.
3. Testing: Write test cases to cover all paths through the function especially edge cases. This includes when the symlink exists or not, and the same for the keysafe's tokens directory.
4. Avoid using globals: Usage of globals can often lead to unexpected behavior. Consider an approach where all the required parameters are passed to the function.
5. Use more secure methods for directory creation to avoid race conditions. The `mkdir -p` command can be vulnerable to race conditions, consider using `mktemp` for safer creation of directories.
