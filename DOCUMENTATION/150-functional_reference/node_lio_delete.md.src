Function signature: 198653d7f8219c254d0f7d905c865d8994dd5dc9072af9cdbc979296660c9662

### Function Overview

The function `node_lio_delete()` is used to delete an iSCSI target and associated backstore in a Linux system. It accepts an iSCSI Qualified Name (IQN) as an argument. This function safeguards by validating the provided argument, checks if the iSCSI target exists before attempting deletion, and similarly for the associated backstore. Post-deletion task involves saving the configuration.

### Technical Description
```bash
Function: node_lio_delete
Description: Deletes an iSCSI target and its associated backstore.
Globals: None
Arguments: 
    - $1: IQN (iSCSI Qualified Name) of the target to be deleted.
Outputs: Logs information about the execution process, which includes successful or unsuccessful deletion of the iSCSI target and the backstore.
Returns:
    - 0 on successful deletion of the target and backstore, or if they do not exist.
    - 1 if the parameter is unknown or missing, or if deletion of the target or backstore is unsuccessful.
Example Usage:
    node_lio_delete --iqn iqn.2003-01.org.linux-iscsi.localhost.x8664:sn.4afce5632cfd
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Add a mechanism to validate the structure of the IQN argument. Validating the IQN increases security by preventing injection or incorrect usage.
2. Add error handling for the `targetcli` execution when executing commands like `targetcli /iscsi delete "${iqn}"`. Execution success should not be implicitly assumed.
3. Incorporate additional logging for more insight into function execution process.
4. Include a mechanism to backup current configuration before making changes. Recovery from failure scenarios can be quicker.
