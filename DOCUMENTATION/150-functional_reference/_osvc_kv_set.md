### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Checks should be implemented to ensure that the key and value arguments are not empty, null, or undefined before their usage. This can avoid unexpected application behavior.
2. Security checks such as character escaping or sanitizing should be applied to prevent possible command injection or other security vulnerabilities.
3. To improve quality, unit tests should be written for this function to ensure expected behavior.
4. Function documentation should be kept updated to align with its latest version or iteration.
5. In terms of security, consider implementing encryption for sensitive data as function parameters.
