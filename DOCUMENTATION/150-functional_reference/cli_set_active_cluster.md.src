### Function Overview

`cli_set_active_cluster` is a Bash function that facilitates the management of clusters within a script or program. This function takes a `cluster_name` as an argument and attempts to set it as the active cluster. If the provided `cluster_name` is the same as the currently active cluster, an information message is printed and the function exits normally. If the user confirms the action (through a yes/no prompt), the function sets `cluster_name` as the active cluster, exports dynamic paths, and commits changes. If any step fails, a corresponding error message is logged and the function returns an error code.

### Technical Description

- **Name:** `cli_set_active_cluster`
- **Description:** This Bash function sets a given cluster as active. It logs errors if the `cluster_name` is not provided or if setting the cluster as active or committing changes fail. It informs the user if the `cluster_name` is already the active cluster.
- **Globals:** 
  - `VAR: desc` (Not clearly defined from the provided function)
- **Arguments:** 
  - `$1: cluster_name` - The name of the cluster to be set as active.
- **Outputs:** 
  - Diagnostic and informational messages about the process are printed to STDOUT/STDERR.
- **Returns:** 
  - `0` if `cluster_name` is already active or if setting `cluster_name` as active and committing changes succeed. 
  - `1` if `cluster_name` is not provided or if setting the cluster as active or committing changes fail. 
  - `2` if the user declines setting `cluster_name` as active.
- **Example usage:** 
  ```bash
  cli_set_active_cluster "MyCluster"
  ```
  
### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Improve error handling by introducing more granularity in error codes for better debugging.
2. Provide a clearer definition and usage of the global variables if the function depends on them.
3. Consider removing the direct dependency on user input for better automation and script-ability. Options and choices should be passed as parameters instead.
4. Ensure that the cluster names and any strings used in comparison are sanitized to prevent potential command injection attacks.
5. Use more explicit variable names for better code readability and maintainability.
