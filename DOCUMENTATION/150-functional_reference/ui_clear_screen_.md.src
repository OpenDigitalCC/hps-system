### Function Overview

The `ui_clear_screen` function in Bash is simply meant to clear any terminal output previously written. It firstly tries to use the `clear` command, but if that fails, it uses an ASCII escape sequence to clear the terminal.

### Technical Description
- **Name**: ui_clear_screen
- **Description**: The function clears the terminal screen.
- **Globals**: None.
- **Arguments**: No arguments needed.
- **Outputs**: None.
- **Returns**: 0 if the screen is cleared successfully. If not successfully, the corresponding error code will be returned.
- **Example usage**: To use this function within your Bash script, you simply need to call it as `ui_clear_screen`. No arguments need to be passed.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# ... Some commands ...

ui_clear_screen

# ... More commands ...
```
This will clear the terminal at that point in the script's execution.

### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. It is recommended to validate the calling environment before executing commands that manipulate the terminal directly.
2. Excessive usage of clear screen function can lead to loss of important information in terminal history. Make sure to use this function only when required.
3. It is recommended to implement error handling mechanisms (like checking the last command return status) to provide a smooth and secure functionality.
4. Consider using echo with newline characters for small amounts of screen clearances instead of using terminal-specific commands. This would improve compatibility with different terminal emulators.
5. Where possible, do not depend on specific environment variables. This function should fail gracefully, with well-defined behaviors, in the absence of environment variables.
6. This function is reliant on system-level commands (`clear` and ASCII escape sequence). Ensure the system these commands are being invoked on supports them to avoid any exceptions or errors.
