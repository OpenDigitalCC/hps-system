### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Validation: At its current state, the function does not validate the IP address it retrieves. This could pose a problem if the command fails for some reason. Implementing basic validation checks would improve the quality of the function.
2. Error handling: In case the command fails to obtain the IP address, the function currently offers no method of detecting and managing such failure. It is recommended to implement error handling to improve robustness.
3. Comments: More explanatory comments should be added in the function to improve maintainability and readability of the function.
4. Security: It's a good practice to limit the privileges of the script that uses this function to avoid potential security risks.
