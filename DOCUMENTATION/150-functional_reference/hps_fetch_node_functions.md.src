Function signature: 50bf6936cdf1453b2bcb8d882d211b60fb60ec8b76f453a8bf656bc65804dba6

### Function Overview

The `hps_fetch_node_functions()` is a bash function that fetches functions from a specific URL without evaluation. The URL is constructed from provisioning node IP address, distro string and a server-side script (boot_manager.sh). The function uses curl for making a HTTP request, and if the request is unsuccessful it returns an error message and error code. The response from the server (i.e., the fetched functions) is then outputted to the stdout.

### Technical Description

- Name: `hps_fetch_node_functions()`
- Description: This function is used to fetch functions from a specified URL without them being evaluated. It generates this URL using a combination of the provisioning IP address, distro string, and server-side script.
- Globals: `N/A`
- Arguments: 
  - `ips_address`: provisioning node IP address from `hps_get_provisioning_node` function
  - `distro`: distribution string from `hps_get_distro_string` function
  - `url`: constructed URL for function fetch
- Outputs: If successful, the function fetches and outputs server response. In case of errors, outputs error messages.
- Returns: 
  - `0` if the function fetch is successfully executed 
  - `1` if the provisioning node IP couldn't be determined
  - `2` if the curl request fails
- Example usage: `hps_fetch_node_functions`

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Implement more robust error handling. Current implementation only checks if there are any errors during the execution of `hps_get_provisioning_node` and the curl operation.
2. Always validate and sanitize inputs to prevent potential security flaws such as code injection.
3. Consider using https for security in communications instead of http.
4. Look for a way to authenticate the server (where the functions are being fetched from) to ensure that you're communicating with a trusted source. 
5. Last but not least, provide an option for the caller to specify a timeout for the curl operation. This will prevent the caller script from hanging indefinitely in the event the server is unresponsive.
