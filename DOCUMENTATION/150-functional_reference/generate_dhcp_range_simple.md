Contained in `lib/functions.d/network-functions.sh`

Function signature: d040dcc216635e3158248e2fd6c7c0ba131ed32bec1b3b2c1708b14f4efd6311

### Function overview

The `generate_dhcp_range_simple()` function computes the range of addresses to be used for DHCP within a given network. It takes in three parameters: the network CIDR, the gateway IP, and an optional count indicating the number of addresses to be included in the range. If the count is not provided, it defaults to 20.

### Technical description

- **Name**: `generate_dhcp_range_simple()`
- **Description**: This function computes the DHCP range, starting from the IP address after the gateway IP and covering the desired count of IP addresses. If this range exceeds the usable network range, it adjusts the start and end points accordingly within valid limits.
- **Globals**: None
- **Arguments**: 
  - `$1`: `network_cidr`: The base network CIDR (e.g. 192.168.50.0/24). 
  - `$2`: `gateway_ip`: The gateway IP address (e.g. 192.168.50.1).
  - `$3`: `count`: Optional argument indicating the size of the DHCP range. If this argument is not provided, it defaults to 20.
- **Outputs**: A string containing the start IP, end IP, and lease time (1h) for the DHCP range, separated by commas.
- **Returns**: None directly from the function, but uses `echo` to output information.
- **Example usage**: 
    ```
    generate_dhcp_range_simple "192.168.50.0/24" "192.168.50.1" "50"
    ```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Sanitize inputs: Before processing, ensure that network CIDR block and gateway IP are in the expected formats. This will help prevent potential code injection or data corruption.
2. Error handling: Add logic to handle cases where `ipcalc` or `ip_to_int` functions fail or produce unexpected outputs. This will increase the robustness of the script.
3. Commenting: Inline comments are helpful. Instead considering breaking larger function into smaller functions with descriptive names to enhance readability of the code.
4. Unit testing: Develop suitable unit tests to ensure that the function behaves as expected under a variety of scenarios (both normal and edge cases).
5. Security: Since it doesn't use globals and doesn't modify external state, `generate_dhcp_range_simple` is already quite secure. For added security, consider avoiding the use of `read` and `case` in a subshell spawned by process substitution, which can be susceptible to code injection attacks. A secured alternative can be using a while-loop to process `ipcalc` output one line at a time directly.
6. Validation: Make sure to validate all function inputs as thoroughly as possible to prevent any unauthorized or malicious data from being processed.
