Function signature: ec6e430fb8789091cfe8fdd4b1e197a7a20d2619e9cb9986827d740d74268de1

### Function Overview

The Bash function `node_zvol_create()` is designed to create a ZFS (Zettabyte File System) volume, or zvol. This is done through the use of environment parameters, namely a pool, name and size, which are parsed and passed as variables to the systemâ€™s `zfs` command. The function validates the provided parameters and checks for the existence of the zvol before attempting to create a new one.

### Technical Description

- **Name**: `node_zvol_create`
- **Description**: This function creates a ZFS volume using given parameters. The parameters are parsed for three variables: pool, name, and size. The function then uses these variables in the `zfs create` command to generate the volume, first checking to ensure that it does not already exist.
- **Globals**: None
- **Arguments**: 
  - $1, $2: These are used by the command to parse the given parameters. Each shift command removes the current value of $1 and assigns the next parameter value to it.
- **Outputs**: conditional logging to a remote destination detailing the function's activity and success or failure to create a volume.
- **Returns**: 
  - 0: Success - zvol was created without issue. 
  - 1: Failure - Either due to an unrecognized parameter, missing required parameters, or pre-existing zvol.
- **Example Usage**:
```bash
node_zvol_create --pool tank --name vol1 --size 1G
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Enforce stricter validation for the 'pool', 'name', and 'size' parameters to prevent any potential command injection attacks or inconsistencies. 
2. Implement robust error handling to make the function more resilient to unexpected behavior and to give more informative responses when something goes wrong.
3. Use unique and clear logging statements to make the progress of the function easier to follow and troubleshoot.
4. Store sensitive data securely to ensure this data isn't exposed to unauthorized access. 
5. For improved auditability, incorporate logging for all major events such as input validation failures, zvol creation failure, and zvol creation success.
6. Find ways to limit the use of global variables to lessen the chances of unwanted side effects from their modification.
7. Whenever possible, encapsulate complex sections of code into their own functions to improve readability and maintainability.
