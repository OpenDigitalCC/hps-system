Function signature: 88bd0071a499bbd8569aa662f5b5a8dc21749e5558c21d25b8da39efca395556

### Function Overview

The function `n_storage_validate_jumbo_frames()` checks for the validity of jumbo frames in a network. It accepts three arguments where the third argument is optional and its default value is set to 9000. The function calculates the size of the ping packet, tests the ability of jumbo frames to reach the target IP with the calculated packet size and logs the activity in both success and fail scenarios. It returns `0` if the test was successful (indicating the validity of jumbo frames), and `1` if it was not successful.

### Technical Description

- Name: `n_storage_validate_jumbo_frames`
- Description: Function to validate jumbo frames in a network.
- Globals: None
- Arguments: 
  - `$1` (vlan_iface): The Vlan Interface in question.
  - `$2` (target_ip): The Target IP where the jumbo frames are being sent.
  - `$3` (expected_mtu): The Expected Maximum Transmission Unit. It is optional, defaulting to 9000.
- Outputs: Logs to `n_remote_log`
- Returns: `0` if jumbo frames are validated successfully, `1` if the validation fails.
- Example usage: `n_storage_validate_jumbo_frames eth0 192.168.0.1 8900`

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Ensure that the network firewall rules do not block the ICMP protocol used for pinging.
2. Verify that the Vlan interface and target IP passed as parameters are valid and reachable.
3. Exception handling can be improved by adding checks for the argument values.
4. Ensure that the error message logged is informative, indicating the possible reasons for failure. 
5. Rather than suppressing shell command errors (&>/dev/null), consider handling them to provide more feedback on what might have gone wrong.
6. To protect against command injection, before executing commands with arguments supplied by user, sanitize the inputs.
7. Consider encapsulating the logic of calculating packet size into a separate function to make the code cleaner and more modular.
