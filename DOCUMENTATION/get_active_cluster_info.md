## `get_active_cluster_info`

Contained in `lib/functions.d/cluster-functions.sh`

### Function overview

The `get_active_cluster_info` function in Bash, primarily, retrieves the information of the active cluster in a directory of clusters. The function evaluates the condition if there is only one cluster, if the active cluster link exists and if multiple clusters exist in the directory. Furthermore, it handles cases where no cluster directories are found or when a cluster configuration does not exist in the active cluster. It can be particularly utilized where a need to systematically read through multiple directories for certain information is required.

### Technical description

**- Name:** `get_active_cluster_info`
**- Description:** The function navigates a cluster directory, evaluates the status of clusters (viz. single, multiple, active, none, etc.), and attempts to output the configuration file path for an appropriate cluster accordingly.
**- Globals:** 
  * `VAR:HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR`: This variable sets the base directory for the cluster configuration. If not set, defaults to `/srv/hps-config/clusters`.
**- Arguments:** None
**- Outputs:** The function primarily outputs the path to the configuration file of, respectively, the single cluster found, the active cluster, or the chosen one amongst multiple clusters.
**- Returns:** Returns 1 if no cluster directories are found or if an active cluster configuration is not found.
**- Example usage:**

```bash
get_active_cluster_info
```

This function does not take any arguments. 

### Quality and security recommendations

* It is suggested to have error handling capabilities for when the base directory does not exist or is not accessible.
* Verification of existence and readability of the selected configuration file prior to echoing the path could be beneficial.
* Introduce logging for activity monitoring and better error tracing. This ensures privacy practices and alerts on unexpected activities.
* Use of unquoted variables could lead to word splitting vulnerabilities. It is recommended to always quote your variables in Bash.
* It is essential to validate and sanitize all inputs into functions to ensure that correct and safe data is being used.
* Implement access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can access, modify, or delete essential data.
