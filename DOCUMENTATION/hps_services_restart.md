### Function Overview
The function `hps_services_restart()` is used to restart all services under the control of the Supervisor process control system. The function first configures the Supervisor services using the `configure_supervisor_services` function. It then reloads the Supervisor configuration using the `reload_supervisor_config` function. Finally, it restarts all services by executing the `supervisorctl restart all` command with the path of the supervisord configuration file specified.

### Quality and Security Recommendations
1. Validate the existence of the `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR` directory. If not present, the function should stop the execution and print an appropriate error message.
2. Gracefully handle potential errors during the execution of `configure_supervisor_services`, `reload_supervisor_config`, and `supervisorctl -c "${HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR}/supervisord.conf" restart all` commands. If there's an error, the function should stop the execution and return or print an appropriate error message.
3. Set appropriate permissions to the `supervisord.conf` file to prevent unauthorized modifications.
4. Consider logging all the actions performed within this function for audit purposes. Log files should be protected against unauthorized access.
5. It is essential to verify if the user calling this function has the necessary permissions to restart the services to prevent misuse.
