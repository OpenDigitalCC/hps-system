### Quality and security recommendations

1. Use more descriptive names for variables, and include comments explaining what each variable is used for.
2. Should configure error handling so if the supervisor service can't be created for any reason, it returns a meaningful error message.
3. The "admin" username is hardcoded, it is recommended to store usernames in environment variables or some sort of secure and encrypted configuration that can be loaded at runtime.
4. The password is currently hardcoded as "ignored-but-needed", this should be replaced with a more secure method, such as a randomly generated password or one provided securely at runtime. Alternatively, it could be removed if it isn't needed.
5. Consider setting the supervisor to run as a non-root user for increased security.
6. Use explicit file permissions when creating directory to prevent unauthorized access.
