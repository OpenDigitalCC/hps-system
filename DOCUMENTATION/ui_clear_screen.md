### Quality and Security Recommendations

- Add error handling: For robustness, consider adding an error message to be printed if both clear and printf commands fail.
- Use full paths for commands: To make the script more secure, use the full paths for system commands like clear and printf. This can prevent command hijacking.
- Although the printf is generally safe, it can potentially be misused. If additional functionality is added in the future, ensure that string arguments passed to printf are not user-supplied to avoid possible command injection vulnerabilities.
- Check whether the terminal supports the operations: For better compatibility, one could check whether the terminal supports clearing the screen and the escape sequence "\033c" before executing them.
