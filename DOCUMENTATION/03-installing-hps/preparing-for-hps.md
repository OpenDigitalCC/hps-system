## Hardware

Depends on the scenario, for example:

- evaluation 
- home lab
- small organisation
- production-grade
- maximum performance


## Obtaining HPS

How to acquire HPS source

- HPS Repo link
- Link to ISO downloads

## Dependencies and prerequisites

- Operating system ISO's


## Designing networking and numbering

HPS will manage hosts on a directly connected LAN as it uses lower-level protocols such as AMC address to manage key functions. If HPS is required on another indirectly connected network, then that should have it's own IPN.

When configuring the cluster, make sure to use a network address that doesn;t conflict with anythihg else. HPS should offer ranges that do not conflict with anything that it can detect.

In almost every case, HPS will be implemented on a new network segment.
