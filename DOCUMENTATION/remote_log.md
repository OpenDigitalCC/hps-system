## `remote_log`

Contained in `lib/functions.d/kickstart-functions.sh`

### Function overview

The `remote_log()` function is designed for sending log messages to a remote server. The function accepts a message as input, then URL-encodes the message, and finally posts the encoded message to a predetermined gateway using the curl command in a bash environment. This function could be useful in scenarios where log data is gathered on one machine but needs to be sent and logged to a remote server for centralized logging and analysis.

### Technical description

Here is the detailed definition block for the `remote_log` function:

- **name**: `remote_log`.
- **description**: This function encodes an input message in URL format and sends it to a specified gateway.
- **globals**: [ `macid`: Used in the URL for the log message to the remote server. Should contain the MAC address of the machine, `HOST_GATEWAY`: Gateway server where the encoded log message is sent.]
- **arguments**: [ `$1`: log message to encode and send, `$2`: not used in the function ]
- **outputs**: Sends the URL-encoded log message to the gateway server.
- **returns**: No return value, but will have side-effects (sending the log message).
- **example usage**: `remote_log "This is a test log message"`

### Quality and security recommendations

Below are some suggested improvements for the `remote_log` function to ensure better quality and security:

1. Validation for the message and the global variables should be added to ensure they are not empty and have valid values.
2. Error handling could be improved â€“ currently, errors (e.g., from curl) are silently ignored.
3. The function currently operates under the assumption that `curl` is available on the system, a check for dependency on curl should be added.
4. The hardcoded URL within the function could potentially pose as a security risk. Consider securing/tidying up this by reading from a secure config file or an environment variable.
5. Data integrity check: Verify the sent message was received/intact at the server side for data reliability.
6. Add debug logging for troubleshooting potential issues.
7. Consider switching to using HTTPS for sending messages to the server to encrypt the data during transmission.
