## `load_cluster_host_type_profiles`

Contained in `lib/functions.d/cluster-functions.sh`

### Function overview
The function `load_cluster_host_type_profiles` loads the configurations of a cluster from a given file. The function reads the active cluster filename and checks if the file exists before proceeding. It then declares a global associate array for storing the host types. The function reads the file line by line, checks for key-value pairs, and stores these pairs in the associative array.

### Technical description
**Name:** load_cluster_host_type_profiles

**Description:** This function is designed to load the profiles of host types in a cluster setting. It reads from a configuration file and populates an associative array with the host types and their corresponding key-value pair profiles.

**Globals:** [ __declared_types: This associative array stores the types of hosts in the cluster. ]

**Arguments:** [ $1: The first argument represents the key in the key-value pair, $2: The second argument represents the value in the key-value pair. ]

**Outputs:** The function does not print any output, instead, it populates a global associative array.

**Returns:** The function will return 1 if the configuration file does not exist; otherwise, no explicit return value is given, which implies a default return value of 0 indicating a successful execution.

**Example Usage:**
```bash
load_cluster_host_type_profiles
```
No parameters are needed to call this function. The specific configuration file and details are handled within the function itself.

### Quality and Security recommendations 
1. Add error handling for file reading operations to catch and handle errors during the execution. 
2. Perform additional validation on each key-value pair read from the configuration file to ensure they are in the expected format. 
3. Provide clear documentation regarding the structure and content of the configuration file to avoid potential misconfiguration by users. 
4. Keep the function updated per any changes to the configuration file structure or content for consistency, avoiding potential issues and errors.
