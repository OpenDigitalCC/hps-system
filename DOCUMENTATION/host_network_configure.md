## `host_network_configure`

Contained in `lib/functions.d/host-functions.sh`

### Function Overview

The function `host_network_configure()` is used to set up various network configurations based on input parameters and specified cluster configurations. The function takes two input arguments - `macid` and `hosttype` - and sets various local network details including network base, DHCP_IP, and DHCP_CIDR from the cluster configuration.

This function also performs various checks and logs appropriate messages in case of missing required parameters or unavailability of the needed command `ipcalc`.

### Technical Description

- Name: `host_network_configure()`
- Description: This function is used to set up various network configurations for a host in a cluster.
- Globals: `macid`, `hosttype`, `dhcp_ip`, `dhcp_cidr`, `netmask`, `network_base`
  - `macid`: The MAC id of the network interface.
  - `hosttype`: The type of the host.
  - `dhcp_ip`: The IP address provided by DHCP.
  - `dhcp_cidr`: CIDR subnet mask provided by DHCP.
  - `netmask`: Network mask computed by `ipcalc`.
  - `network_base`: Network base address computed by `ipcalc`.
- Arguments: `$1`, `$2`
  - `$1`: The MAC id of the network interface.
  - `$2`: The type of the host.
- Outputs: Logs details of success and failure events.
- Returns: `1` when required parameters are missing or required command is not available, otherwise it doesn't explicitly return any value.
- Example usage:
`host_network_configure "MAC_ID" "HOST_TYPE"`

### Quality and Security Recommendations

- The function should return unambiguous values consistently. It does not explicitly specify a return on success, just failure.
- The function utilizes the `ipcalc` command, the absence of which triggers a non-zero exit code. This creates a dependency which should be clearly documented.
- Integrate input validation to ensure that the `macid` and `hosttype` arguments being passed to the function are well-formed to avoid undefined behavior.
- Log sensitivity data such as IP addresses, CIDR notations, netmasks etc. can lead to security risks. Always ensure that logs do not expose sensitive details unless absolutely necessary and approved.
- Employ permission checks to ensure that the script is not executed with higher than necessary privileges, which can potentially compromise security.
- The function should include more detailed error handling, including potential issues with sourcing `cluster_config`, and extraction of `dhcp_ip` and `dhcp_cidr`.
