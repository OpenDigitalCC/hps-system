Contained in `lib/functions.d/cluster-functions.sh`

### Function overview

The `get_host_type_param` function is a Bash function that accepts two arguments and uses them to query a referenced associative array. Depending on the values of the arguments, it retrieves and echoes a value from the referenced array. If non-existent keys are queried, the function will echo an empty string.

### Technical description

- **name**: `get_host_type_param`
- **description**: This Bash function accepts two arguments which represent the name of an associative array and a key. It uses them to reference the array and echo back the corresponding value. If the key doesn't exist in the array, the function will echo an empty string.
- **globals**: None
- **arguments**: 
   - `$1`: This argument should be the name of an associative array which is to be directly referenced.
   - `$2`: This argument should be a key in the associative array defined by `$1`.
- **outputs**: Echoes the value corresponding to the key in the associative array or an empty string if the key is not found.
- **returns**: None
- **example usage**:
    ```bash
    declare -A my_array=(["key"]="value")
    get_host_type_param "my_array" "key"    # Returns: value
    get_host_type_param "my_array" "nokey"  # Returns: (Empty string)
    ```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. For improved security, consider validating the input. Specifically, ensure the first argument is a declared associative array and the second argument is a string.
2. When declaring associative arrays, consider having a naming convention that differentiates them from normal variables. This way, it is easier to avoid programming errors where a normal variable is mistakenly passed as the first argument.
3. To avoid unexpected behavior, consider adding error handling that will inform the user if a key does not exist in the array.
4. Consider adding a check to ensure the referenced variable `ref` does not already exist in other parts of your code before declaring it. Overwriting variables could potentially result in bugs.
