## API and intercommunications

hps communicates internally through bash functions.

System administrator can use the CLI for some operations, that uses the library functions underneath. Also there is the iPXE interface available for booting systems.

Communications between the IPS and hosts is done through HTTP calls, as well as dhcp and syslog.
