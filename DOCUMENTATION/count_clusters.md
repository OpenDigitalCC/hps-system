## `count_clusters`

Contained in `lib/functions.d/cluster-functions.sh`

### Function overview

The function `count_clusters` is designed to count the cluster directories present in a base directory and output the count. The base directory is specified by the environment variable `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR`. If the base directory does not exist or no clusters are found within it, the function informs the user through a message output to stderr and returns zero.

### Technical description

- **Name:** count_clusters
- **Description:** This function counts the cluster directories in a given base directory specified by the variable `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR` and outputs the count. If the base directory does not exist or there are no clusters, it outputs an error message to stderr and returns zero.
- **Globals:** 
  - `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR`: This is the path to the base directory containing the clusters.
- **Arguments:** None.
- **Outputs:** If successful, reports the number of cluster directories present in the base directory. On failure (base directory doesn't exist or contains no clusters), prints an error message to stderr and returns `0`.
- **Returns:** Always returns `0`. The main purpose of the function is to output the count to stdout.
- **Example usage:**
  - `count_clusters`
  
### Quality and security recommendations

- Validation should be added to ensure that `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR` is not null or empty.
- The function's dependence on a global variable `HPS_CLUSTER_CONFIG_BASE_DIR` may be replaced with an argument, increasing reusability of the function and minimizing side effects.
- Consider providing more specific error messages for edge cases, such as when the path is not a directory or when the path is not permitted.
- For security, it'd be best to confirm the user has necessary permissions for the given path to avoid unexpected behavior.
- It might be beneficial to verify that each item in `clusters` is actually a directory, not a file.
- The script should make sure that the necessary commands, such as `shopt`, are available before calling them.
- The function's return value should reflect its success or failure. Currently, it always returns 0, which typically indicates successful execution.
