## `build_yum_repo`

Contained in `lib/functions.d/repo-functions.sh`

### Function overview
The `build_yum_repo` function is a Bash function designed to create or update a YUM repository. This function validates the provided input, checks for the presence of the `createrepo_c` command, checks for changes in RPM files in the given directory, updates the repository if changes are detected or no previous state exists, and stores the current state.

### Technical description 

- **name**: build_yum_repo
- **description**: The function is used within a Bash script to create or update a YUM repository.
- **globals**: None
- **arguments**: 
  - $1: repo_path - The path string to the directory containing RPM files to be checked and potentially updated in the repository.
- **outputs**: All logs are outputs and are either an error message regarding a missing variable or directory, a status message about the function's progress, or a success message stating the repository's successfully built.
- **returns**: The function can return 3 potential values. If there is an issue with the provided path variable or the directory does not exist, the function will return 1. If the `createrepo_c` command is missing, the function will return 2. If the function successfully creates or updates the repository, or if there are no changes needed, it will return 0.
- **example usage**: 
```bash
build_yum_repo "${HPS_PACKAGES_DIR}/${DIST_STRING}/Repo"
```

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Consider adding more comments within the function to increase readability.
2. Enhance error handling. For instance, handle the scenario where the script does not have write access to the check-sum file or the repository path.
3. Validate the `createrepo_c` command's successful installation by checking its return value rather than the presence of the command.
4. Verify the RPM files' integrity in the repository path, if not checked elsewhere.
5. Consider using more descriptive names for local variables. It would increase the readability and maintainability of the code.
6. Be sure to keep all software up-to-date, including the `createrepo_c` package, to ensure you have the latest security patches.
