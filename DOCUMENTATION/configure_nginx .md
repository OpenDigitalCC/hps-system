## `configure_nginx `

Contained in `lib/functions.d/configure_nginx.sh`

### Function overview
The function `configure_nginx` is a Bash function designed to set up configuration settings for the Nginx web server for a specific cluster environment. The function's main functionality is to direct standard error to null and source the active cluster filename. It also defines file paths and presets the Nginx configuration file `nginx.conf`.

### Technical description
- **Name**: configure_nginx
- **Description**: This function initializes Nginx configuration for the active cluster environment. It sources the filename of the active cluster, which it retrieves via the `get_active_cluster_filename` function. It then creates (or overwrites) the `nginx.conf` file using a heredoc, setting certain preset configurations.
- **Globals**: 
   - HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR: The directory containing service configuration files.
- **Arguments**: None
- **Outputs**: A `nginx.conf` file in the directory specified by `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR`, containing basic Nginx configuration parameters.
- **Returns**: No return value.
- **Example Usage**:
    ```bash
    configure_nginx 
    ```
   
### Quality and security recommendations
- It's important to remember to handle errors appropriately and not just direct them to null. You may want to add error handling for when the `get_active_cluster_filename` function fails to retrieve a filename.
- The function currently assumes that the global variable `HPS_SERVICE_CONFIG_DIR` is correctly set. It would be beneficial to validate this assumption before using the variable.
- Hard-coding configuration settings for Nginx within the function may not be ideal for differing environments. Consider parameterizing these settings or retrieving them from an outside source to increase flexibility.
- Redirecting standard error to null can be risky as it may overlook potential problems, consider logging errors instead.
- It is recommended to consistently use double quotes around variable references to prevent word splitting and filename expansion.
- Make sure that only authorized users have write access to the `nginx.conf` file, as unauthorized access may lead to security vulnerabilities.
