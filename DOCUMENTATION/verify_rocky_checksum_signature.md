## `verify_rocky_checksum_signature`

Contained in `lib/functions.d/iso-functions.sh`

### Function Overview

The function `verify_rocky_checksum_signature` verifies the authenticity of the downloaded Rocky Linux ISO files by checking the expected checksum with the actual checksum. It starts by specifying the version number and architecture (currently limited to x86_64). Several file paths are then defined, including the base URL for the files, the targets directory, and paths for the checksum and signature files. 

The checksum and its signature are downloaded, and the Rocky Linux public GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) key is imported. The GPG signature for the checksum file is then verified. If verification passes, the same checksum is used to confirm the accuracy and integrity of the downloaded ISO files. If verification fails at any point, the function returns an error code and a message detailing at what point the verification process stopped.

### Technical Description

- **name:** `verify_rocky_checksum_signature`
- **description:** Verifies the checksum and its signature for the specified Rocky Linux ISO. If verification is successful, checks the expected checksum with the actual checksum for the ISO.
- **globals:** `HPS_DISTROS_DIR` : This variable sets the base directory where various Linux distribution ISOs will be stored.
- **arguments:** `$1: version` : The version number of the Rocky Linux distribution whose checksum should be verified.
- **outputs:** Echoes the steps of the process and the results of each verification.
- **returns:**  `0` if the every step (including the signature and checksum checks) pass. `1` if the GPG key import fails. `2` if signature verification fails. `3` if no matching checksum can be found for the ISO name. `4` if the actual ISO checksum does not match the expected checksum.
- **example usage:** `verify_rocky_checksum_signature 8`

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. To improve security, consider using more secure encryption methods or addition of password or passphrase for GPG keys.
2. Implement a strategy for handling updating GPG keys.
3. Expand the function to handle different processor architectures other than "x86_64".
4. In terms of quality of code, consider refactor or externalize the repeated `curl` commands into a separate function.
5. If the external resources (e.g., public keys) move or are renamed, the script will fail. Employ an error-handling mechanism for unavailable resources.
6. Validate user input to ensure it fits expected parameters. For instance, verifying version number is a positive integer.
