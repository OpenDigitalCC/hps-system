## `ipxe_boot_from_disk `

Contained in `lib/functions.d/ipxe-menu-functions.sh`

### Function Overview

The function `ipxe_boot_from_disk` is designed to boot from the local disk via BIOS by exiting the iPXE stack. It first calls another function `ipxe_header` to prepare the iPXE environment. Then it issues a series of `echo` commands to instruct the system to print a message, delay for some time, and eventually exit the iPXE environment, handing over control to BIOS for booting from the local disk.

### Technical Description

- **Name**: ipxe_boot_from_disk
- **Description**: This function is used to boot from the local disk via BIOS by exiting the iPXE stack. It first initiates the iPXE environment with `ipxe_header`, then prints a message, adds a small pause, and exits the system.
- **Globals**: None
- **Arguments**: No arguments are accepted by this function.
- **Outputs**: The function prints out the message "Handing back to BIOS to boot"
- **Returns**: Does not return a value.
- **Example Usage**: 
```bash
ipxe_boot_from_disk
```

### Quality and Security Recommendations

1. Implement a function guard to prevent the function from being sourced and run unintentionally.
2. Operate robustness in edge cases, specifically, specify what happens if `ipxe_header` function doesn't execute as expected.
3. Add error handling for external calls (in this case `ipxe_header`), ensuring the function can handle if any error occurs.
4. Considering the `echo` command could potentially be hijacked for arbitrary command execution, use the `printf` function for safer output.
5. Because the function does printf to stdout directly, consider adding an option for silent running.
6. Always consider the implications of allowing your script to sleep in a production environment. Could this cause other operations to time out? Could it allow race conditions to introduce errors?
7. Make sure that the function does not contain hardcoded secrets or sensitive information.
8. Check for the necessary permissions before attempting to boot from disk, gracefully handle the case if permission is denied.
9. A potential improvement could be to make the sleep time configurable as different systems may require different wait times before booting.  
10. A security improvement could be to verify that booting from BIOS was successful and no errors were thrown during the process.
