## `ipxe_init `

Contained in `lib/functions.d/ipxe-menu-functions.sh`

### Function overview

The `ipxe_init` function is a process involved within a cluster. This function comes into play when the cluster is configured and the host is not yet identified due to the absence of the MAC address. It provides an iPXE menu to unknown hosts. It seeks to find a configuration and load it based on the MAC address and a CGI_URL. This function prints out the config URL, fetches the config, loads it, states the image status, and executes the config. There is a commented section in place to handle situations where no host configuration is found.

### Technical description

### Quality and security recommendations

1. Adding error handling apart from the commented section
2. Ensuring that the `CGI_URL` is defined and valid 
3. Checking that the host MAC address used in the `config_url` is valid
4. Securing the `CGI_URL` as it may expose sensitive information
5. There are commented lines of codes in the function. For code readability, remove them if they are not necessary or provide adequate explanations otherwise.
