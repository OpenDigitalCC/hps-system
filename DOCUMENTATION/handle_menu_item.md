## `handle_menu_item`

Contained in `lib/functions.d/ipxe-menu-functions.sh`

### Function Overview
The `handle_menu_item` function, as the name suggests, is used to handle various menu-related operations in BASH. This function receives two arguments; the first being the item (or the operation) to be performed and the second being the machine address (MAC). Subsequently, based on the type of item, this function performs a specific operation such as `init_menu`, `install_menu` etc.

Each menu item operation is nested inside a case block which allows the function to choose which operation to perform based on the argument received. The function also provides for fail-safes and logs for each operation to track any potential errors or misconfigurations.

### Technical Description
Below is a detailed technical breakdown of the function `handle_menu_item`:

- **Name:** `handle_menu_item`
- **Description:** This function is responsible for handling various menu-related operations based on the provided arguments.
- **Globals:** None.
- **Arguments:**
  - `$1: item` - Represents the specific operation to be performed.
  - `$2: mac` - Represents the MAC address.
- **Outputs:** Depends on the operation selected. However, in general, it could be logs, errors, initiation of other functions or changing states.
- **Returns:** None, i.e., null.
- **Example usage:** `handle_menu_item reboot 00:11:22:33:44:55`

### Quality and Security Recommendations
- It might be beneficial to implement better error handling. Currently, the function only provides a message for an unknown menu item; however, improved error handling could capture a broader range of potential issues.
- The fail-safe `*)` could potentially be more informative about what menu items would be valid. Users might make a typographical error and not know what the correct options are.
- Avoid using echo for generating output. There are safer alternatives such as printf that better handle potential issues related to arbitrary content.
- Several sections of the function seem to contain hardcoded sections that could potentially be moved towards a more dynamic or data driven approach.
- Add input validation check at the beginning to ensure the menu item and Mac address values are not empty.
